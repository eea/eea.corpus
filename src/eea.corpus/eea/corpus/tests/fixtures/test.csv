"noise-pollution-in-the-spotlight  Noise pollution in the spotlight  In April, the European Environment Agency will help raise awareness of the growing problem of noise pollution across Europe. We discussed with Colin Nugent, an EEA noise pollution expert, the very real health impacts of noise which are often underestimated.    Why is noise pollution so important?    If you were to talk to most experts about pollution they tend to point to air pollution, water or waste. Noise tends to be one of the forgotten pollutants. However, if you look at environmental surveys, you see that citizens bring it up. People can connect much more to noise as a pollutant because invariably almost everyone has experienced a noise problem. Although they may not be fully aware of the health impacts, they can hear it very clearly and they know they are annoyed by it. Exposure to noise generally raises your stress levels, it raises your ‘fight-or-flight’ instinct in terms of threatening noises like aircraft, or very busy highways near your home. If you are subjected to those noise levels on a long term basis, as many urban dwellers in Europe are, it has an impact. The hyper tension and stress caused by exposure to noise can cause cardiovascular disease, stroke and ultimately mortality. So without realising it, the health impacts of noise are very real. Considering how many people live in cities in Europe and how our cities are expanding and how our demand for transport, mobility, extra flights, is also growing, noise is becoming a major issue for all of us.   What are the top three noise emitters in Europe?   If you ask an average citizen on the street, they will tell you it’s his or her next door neighbour’s dog, or the neighbour’s party on the weekend — a direct annoyance which effects your quality of life. People might not be completely aware that there is a major highway near their house; they hear it all the time, but they get used to it – it is background noise. But when we are looking at larger European Environment Agency assessments, the top emitter is our road transport network, followed by railways and aircraft noise. Aircraft noise tends to have more detrimental health effects than the others. However, the numbers of people exposed to aircraft are a good deal lower than they are for road traffic, because the road transport network is widespread, while airports are concentrated. Railway noise is also an issue but it tends to be more concentrated as well, and it can be easier to tackle. It’s not the same in case of road transport. There are so many vehicles, maintenance is up to the owner and there are so many different standards in terms of vehicles.   What has the European Union done to address the problem?   The EU has a very challenging target in the 7 th  Environment Action Programme - that is to significantly reduce noise pollution by 2020. It also aims to draw closer to the World Health Organization standards, because there are considerable differences. The EU also has a significant amount of legislation in place, including the Environmental Noise Directive, which requires assessments done by noise mapping and action plans to be drawn up. This directive is designed to inform other pieces of legislation covering emissions from road vehicles, trucks, trains, and aircraft. The directive also sets a number of noise indicators to be applied in noise mapping. These indicators represent a physical scale for the description of environmental noise. The two most important are the day-evening-night indicator, designed to assess annoyance, and the night-level indicator (Lnight) which is designed to assess sleep disturbance. These indicators are to be applied to mapping exposure assessments beginning at 55 decibels (dB) for day exposure and 50 dB for night exposure.   What is the EEA doing in assessing noise pollution?    We use the data gathered from mapping to publish regular assessments. Our reports are designed to inform policy makers and to raise awareness of the problem. To mark this year’s International Noise Awareness Day (26 April), we will publish a briefing with updated data on noise levels across Europe. The  last report was published in 2014 . This year is quite a big year for noise. The European Commission has decided to make this one if its key awareness raising initiatives for the year, to make Europeans aware of the problem of noise, what’s being done and what needs to be done still to improve the acoustic environment in Europe. Our upcoming briefing coincides with the Noise in Europe conference in Brussels on 24 April, where our Executive Director will present our latest findings. Although we are getting new information all the time, we still have gaps in the data. The more complete data we have, the more we can improve our knowledge of the problem, and policy makers will be better informed to take better action.   What can citizens do to reduce exposure to noise?   We can certainly look at changing the way we do things, take for example electric vehicles. They give a very immediate benefit, not only for air quality but also for noise emissions. They are very quiet vehicles. When you drive on city streets, you are driving at such low speeds generally, that electric cars give a very real benefit in terms of reduced noise emissions. Europe also has a labelling system for road tyres. It informs the consumer not only about the energy efficiency of the tyre, its safety, but also about the noise emission of the tyre. So consumers can choose quieter tyres. There is also the ‘Quiet mark’ labelling scheme where consumers can choose to buy fridges and other appliances, or lawn mowers that have the quiet labels, for example.

"what-does-nature-mean-to  What does nature mean to you?  NATURE@work photo competition launched  Nature works hard to protect us and to sustain our everyday lives — a fact that is often under-appreciated. But it plays a vital role, providing clean air, clean drinking water, clothing, food and raw materials we use to build shelter. Other benefits are not so well known, such as the role nature plays in alleviating the effects of climate change. To highlight the important role nature plays in our lives, the European Environment Agency (EEA) invites you to participate in capturing how nature benefits you through the ‘NATURE@work’ photography competition.   The EEA’s annual photo competition aims to engage with Europeans around different environmental issues and this year’s competition focuses on the benefits we receive from nature. Did you know that green spaces in and around our cities help protect our homes from flooding by absorbing excess flood water, or that trees and urban parks help lower temperatures in urban areas during heatwaves? With its intrinsic beauty and rich diversity, nature is also a source of inspiration not only for art but also for designing machines, homes and many innovation solutions.    The European Union has been committed to protecting nature and biodiversity since the 1970s . This year marks the 25 th  anniversary of the adoption of one of the key nature protection laws in the EU, the Habitats Directive. With this legislation, the EU has built the largest coordinated network of protected areas in the world through Natura 2000, which covers 18% of the EU’s land area and more than 6% of its seas territories. These efforts are supported by LIFE, the EU’s financial instrument for environmental, nature conservation and climate action projects.  The EU is also active in finding nature-based solutions to support economic growth, create jobs and enhance our well-being .   The ‘NATURE@work’ photo competition is open to all European citizens over the age of 18 and invites them to submit photographs that illustrate any of the following three themes:     NATUREprovides: Can you capture in a photo the benefits nature makes available that you cherish most?   NATUREprotects: Have you noticed how the nature around you – in the countryside, your town or city, protects you?   NATUREinspires: Can you spot anything around you that was inspired by nature?      The winners in each category above will be awarded a cash prize. All entries may be promoted by the EEA and its partners across Europe. You can submit your photos until 15 August.

"effective-policies-are-based-on  Effective policies are based on a robust knowledge base and solid science  At all governance levels, public policy making entails making decisions between different options and approaches. Some decisions, such as to invest in fossil fuels or renewables, might involve selecting one option over the other. Others might address the ‘how’ question – we will invest in renewables but which ones are the best for the society? Each policy decision results in outcomes, some of which might be unforeseen, unexpected or even detrimental to those whose lives it is supposed to improve. In the long term, the overall harm can be much larger than gains in the short term. To achieve the positive and lasting results on the ground, policy makers need to be able to make informed decisions, after assessing the benefits and costs of each available option.   An effective policy almost always relies on science. Similarly, measuring the effectiveness of a policy decision requires targets, which in turn entail a mechanism to monitor progress over time. Target setting and progress reporting also rely on scientific methods and evidence. These approaches are embedded throughout the European Union’s environment and climate policies.      The EU’s air quality policies, for example, aim to reduce the harm caused by various air pollutants and pollution sources. Long-term exposure to even low doses of air pollution constitutes a health risk, affecting us all at varying degrees. Medical science has long confirmed the links between poor air quality and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, impacting the young and the elderly in particular.   Science can identify causes and solutions   To monitor EU air pollution, Member States have set up more than 2 000 monitoring stations, regularly reporting the concentrations of various air pollutants in city centres, on roadsides or in rural areas. All this data is measured and processed in a way that is coherent across the EU and comparable over time. This reporting infrastructure allows policy makers to understand where and why there are pollution exceedances and helps inform what they can do to tackle it. Air quality modelling, informed by best science, is instrumental in identifying cause and effect relations, such as the number of diesel cars or coal-fired power plants and their impacts on urban air quality. This type of understanding is essential for designing appropriate policy responses and solutions.    At the local level, many cities have taken specific action to improve air quality. For example, the mayors of Paris, Madrid and Athens have proposed measures to ban diesel cars and vans from city centres by 2025 to improve air quality and reduce the associated damage to human health. Other cities struggling with repeated air pollution episodes are having to consider similar actions.     Trends can trigger action    In other cases, science-based evidence does not need to be time and location specific to provide reliable information, highly relevant to policy decisions. Informed policy decisions do not always need to be taken on the basis of complex spreadsheets listing hourly ozone readings at every monitoring station. Trend lines can equally strongly convey the message that action must be taken to reduce air pollution and its health impacts. Even with gaps in data, environmental and climate trends can send out a strong and convincing call for policy action.     Although the scope of climate science, including the multiple impacts of climate change, is very broad and deals with a level of complexity, non-linear relations, tipping points and thus a number of uncertainties, its central findings are quite clear: our planet is warming and our dependence on fossil fuels contributes to this warming. We also know that certain regions, not only across the globe but also in Europe, will be more affected by the adverse impacts of climate change than others. These findings have triggered many ambitious policies both at EU and global levels, including the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and the Paris Agreement under the United Nations umbrella.     In fact, uncertainty and data gaps do not undermine the validity of scientific conclusions. They are an integral part of science and are clearly acknowledged in assessments. By acknowledging potential weaknesses, scientific knowledge evolves continuously, improving its methods, models and analysis.     Improvements in scientific knowledge and progress reporting towards a policy target can lead to policy improvements, such as adjustments to testing methods of carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans or setting more rigorous climate and energy targets for 2030.     Our core work at the European Environment Agency deals directly with conveying scientific knowledge to policy makers and the public. We are a knowledge institution at the centre of an extensive network ( European Environment Information and Observation Network ), bringing together experts from national institutions and other bodies across 39 European countries. The EEA provides independent and reliable information on a wide range of topics linked to Europe’s environment and climate. It helps compile data collected by its Member countries and ensures their quality.

"cities-taking-action-learning-from  Cities taking action, learning from each other to adapt to climate change  Despite budgetary challenges, cities and towns across Europe are taking action to put in place measures that will help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. A new European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today highlights the opportunities open to municipalities to share best practices and how they can support projects like green roofs or expanding city parks to help alleviate the negative effects of climate change.   The EEA report  Financing urban adaptation to climate change, takes a closer look at innovative funding options now being used, such as green bonds and crowdfunding, alongside traditional funding channels. The report includes case studies that analyse how 11 cities across Europe are developing, funding and implementing urban adaptation measures. The case studies outline various projects that will help cities better protect themselves from the damage caused by extreme weather events. These include building more green spaces and installing green roofs, which enhance water retention and provide cooling as well as thermal insulation.   The publication is meant to serve as a resource for adaptation financing providers and project developers from international, national or regional public bodies and private institutions. The report also includes a helpful annex providing an overview of European-level financing options available to municipalities.   Innovative funding options   The costs needed to adapt cities to the effects of climate change vary but can run into millions of euros. The lack of funding has been cited by mayors, city managers and planners as one of the main reasons for the slow uptake of adaptation. Public funds for adaptation measures can be difficult to find in wake of other budgetary priorities. At the same time, many European cities and towns are facing significant investment needs to replace old infrastructure for basic services (such as sewer systems), buildings and transport over the next decade. Integrating climate adaptation requirements into such investments would save money in the long term, the report argues.   Municipalities across Europe have found different ways to finance adaptation. These range from tapping into public funds to more innovative financing mechanisms, including crowdfunding and green bonds. Green infrastructure measures with multiple benefits, such as nature conservation, recreation and quality of life, are receiving increased attention. Demonstrating multiple benefits of such measures can increase the chance of securing funds.   Cities are also organising themselves to share best practices and promote environmental cooperation through the  Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy  and other similar organisations.   The European Union has earmarked at least 20 percent of all its expenditures during the 2014-2020 budget period for climate change action  for mitigation and adaptation. Further national and regional financial streams are also available. However, the funds available through the EU and national and regional authorities meet only a small part of the investment needed.

"climate-change-poses-increasingly-severe  Climate change poses increasingly severe risks for ecosystems, human health and the economy in Europe  Europe’s regions are facing rising sea levels and more extreme weather, such as more frequent and more intense heatwaves, flooding, droughts and storms due to climate change, according to a European Environment Agency report published today. The report assesses the latest trends and projections on climate change and its impacts across Europe and finds that better and more flexible adaptation strategies, policies and measures will be crucial to lessen these impacts.   The observed changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, according to the report ‘ Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016 ’. New records continue to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic. Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing. At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.   ‘Climate change will continue for many decades to come. The scale of future climate change and its impacts will depend on the effectiveness of implementing our global agreements to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also ensuring that we have the right adaptation strategies and policies in place to reduce the risks from current and projected climate extremes,’ said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director.   Climate change hotspots   All European regions are vulnerable to climate change, but some regions will experience more negative impacts than others. Southern and south-eastern Europe is projected to be a climate change hotspot, as it is expected to face the highest number of adverse impacts. This region is already experiencing large increases in heat extremes and decreases in precipitation and river flows, which have heightened the risk of more severe droughts, lower crop yields, biodiversity loss and forest fires. More frequent heat waves and changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive infectious diseases are expected to increase risks to human health and well-being.   Coastal areas and floodplains in western parts of Europe are also seen as hotspots as they face an increased risk of flooding from rising sea levels and a possible increase in storm surges. Climate change is also leading to major changes in marine ecosystems as a result of ocean acidification, warming and the expansion of oxygen-depleted dead zones.   Ecosystems and human activities in the Arctic will also be strongly affected owing to the particularly rapid increase in air and sea temperatures and the associated melting of land and sea ice.   Although some regions may also experience some positive impacts, such as improving conditions for agriculture in parts of northern Europe, most regions and sectors will be negatively affected.   Map ES.1 Key observed and projected climate change and impacts for the main biogeographical regions in Europe           Source: EEA, 2017     Ecosystems, human health and economy   Ecosystems and protected areas across Europe are under pressure from climate change and other stressors, such as land use change. The report highlights that the impacts of climate change are a threat to biodiversity at land and in the seas. Many animal and plant species are experiencing changes to their life cycles and are migrating northwards and to higher altitudes, while various invasive species have established themselves or have expanded their range. Marine species, including commercially important fish stocks, are also migrating northwards. These changes affect various ecosystem services and economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries.   The main health effects of climate change are linked to extreme weather events, changes in the distribution of climate-sensitive diseases, and changes in environmental and social conditions. River and coastal flooding has affected millions of people in Europe in the last decade. The health effects include injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense, leading to tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe. This trend is projected to increase and to intensify, unless appropriate adaptation measures are taken. The spread of tick species, the Asian tiger mosquito and other disease carriers increases the risk of Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, West Nile fever, dengue, chikungunya and leishmaniasis.   The economic costs of climate change can be very high. Climate-related extreme events in EEA member countries account for more than EUR 400 billion of economic losses since 1980. Available estimates of the future costs of climate change in Europe consider only some sectors and show considerable uncertainty. Still, the projected damage costs from climate change are highest in the Mediterranean region. Europe is also affected by climate change impacts occurring outside Europe through trade effects, infrastructure, geopolitical and security risks, and migration.   Enhancing adaptation and knowledge   Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into other policies is progressing but can be further enhanced. Other possible further actions include improving policy coherence across different policy areas and governance levels (EU, transnational, national and subnational), more flexible adaptive management approaches, and the combination of technological solutions, ecosystem-based approaches and ‘soft’ measures.   The development and use of climate and adaptation services are increasing in Europe. Improved knowledge would be useful in various areas, for example, on vulnerability and risk assessments at various scales and on monitoring, reporting and evaluation of adaptation actions, their costs and benefits, and synergies and trade-offs with other policies.   Background   The report is an indicator-based assessment of past and projected climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and society. It also looks at society’s vulnerability to these impacts and at the development of adaptation policies and the underlying knowledge base.   The report was developed by the EEA in collaboration with the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe and three European Topic Centres (ETC-CCA, ETC-BD, ETC-ICM). This is the fourth ‘Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe’ report, which is published every four years.

"assessment  Economic losses from climate-related extremes     The total reported economic losses caused by weather and climate-related extremes in the EEA member countries over the period 1980-2015 amount to around EUR 433 billion (in 2015 Euro values). The average annual economic losses have varied between EUR 7.5billion in the period 1980-1989, EUR 13.5 billion in the period 1990-1999, and EUR 14.3 billion in the period 2000-2009. In the period from 2010 to 2015 the average annual loss accounted to around EUR 13.3 billion.    The observed variations in reported economic loss over time are difficult to interpret since a large share of the total deflated losses has been caused by a small number of events. Specifically, more than 70 % of the economic losses was caused by only 3 % of all registered events.     natural hazards in eea weather and climate extremes damage weather damage natural catastrophes statistics natural disasters climate damage climate change       CSI CSI042 CLIM CLIM039 042 039,<p><b>Past trends</b></p> <p>According to data from NatCatService of Munich Re <a href='file:///G:/ACC/1.4%20Vulnerability%20&amp;amp;%20adaptation/1.4.2%20CC%20adaptation%20&amp;amp;%20disaster%20risk%20reduction%20assessments/EEA%202017%20CCA-DRR%20Report/CLIM039/V2/CLIM039_2016_3.docx#_ftn4' title=''>[4]</a>on natural disasters between 1980 and 2015 in the member countries of European Environment Agency (EEA), weather and climate-related extremes <a href='file:///G:/ACC/1.4%20Vulnerability%20&amp;amp;%20adaptation/1.4.2%20CC%20adaptation%20&amp;amp;%20disaster%20risk%20reduction%20assessments/EEA%202017%20CCA-DRR%20Report/CLIM039/V2/CLIM039_2016_3.docx#_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a> accounted for 92% of total reported disaster events and around 83% of the total losses.

The highest overall economic losses in absolute terms were registered in Germany, Italy and United Kingdom (see Figure/Table 1). The highest losses per capita were recorded in Switzerland, Denmark, and Austria. The greatest shares of total losses in terms of cumulative GDP were registered in Croatia, Czech Republic, and Hungary. The three least affected countries in absolute terms were Liechtenstein, Iceland and Malta. In relative terms (per capita) the least affected countries include Turkey, Estonia and Latvia. In terms of loss as a share of cumulative GDP, the least affected countries include Liechtenstein, Iceland and Estonia.</p> <p>The largest 34 events caused about half of the recorded losses. The costliest climate extremes were the 2002 flood in Central Europe (almost EUR 20 billion), followed by the 2003 drought and heatwave (EUR 15 billion) and 1999 winter storm, Lothar (EUR 15 billion).</p> <p>One important question is to what extent the observed increase in overall losses during recent decades is attributable to changing climatic conditions rather than other factors. According to AR5 of the IPCC <a href='file:///G:/ACC/1.4%20Vulnerability%20&amp;amp;%20adaptation/1.4.2%20CC%20adaptation%20&amp;amp;%20disaster%20risk%20reduction%20assessments/EEA%202017%20CCA-DRR%20Report/CLIM039/V2/CLIM039_2016_3.docx#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>, increasing exposure of people and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic losses from weather and climate-related disasters. Long-term trends in economic disaster losses, adjusted for wealth and population increases, have not been attributed to climate change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded.</p> <p><span>Available studies for economic losses from river floods and storms in Europe suggest that the observed increases in losses are primarily due to increases in populations, economic wealth and developments in hazard-prone areas, but the observed increase in heavy precipitation in parts of Europe may have also played a role</span><a href='file:///G:/ACC/1.4%20Vulnerability%20&amp;amp;%20adaptation/1.4.2%20CC%20adaptation%20&amp;amp;%20disaster%20risk%20reduction%20assessments/EEA%202017%20CCA-DRR%20Report/CLIM039/V2/CLIM039_2016_3.docx#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a><span>.

Around 64 % of all economic losses were due to meteorological and hydrological events, while most of fatalities were caused by heat waves. </span><span>This large portion of fatalities is highly influenced by the heatwave of 2003, where around 70 000 fatalities were reported as excess mortality (Figure 2).</span><span></span></p> <p><span>Recorded economic losses from weather and climate related extremes in Europe have varied substantially over time. The average annual economic loss (inflation-corrected) was around EUR 7.5 billion per year in the 1980s (1980-1989), EUR 13.4 billion in the 1990s (1990-1999), EUR 14.3 billion per year in the 2000s (2000-2009). In the period 2010 to 2015 , the average annual economic loss accounted to around EUR 13.3 billion (Figure 3). However, the pattern that can be found in the recorded loss is obfuscated by high variability: around 3% of events, some of which affected more than one country, account for around 70% of total deflated loss. Conversely, some three quarters of the registered events were responsible for only half a percentage point of the total losses. The increased economic wealth has a major effect on the annual losses.</span></p> <p>Currently there is no mechanism in place for reporting the economical losses from weather and weather and climate-related events by the EU member states to the European Commission or the EEA. However activities are underway to improve national databases on disaster losses, coordinated by JRC IPSC<a href='file:///G:/ACC/1.4%20Vulnerability%20&amp;amp;%20adaptation/1.4.2%20CC%20adaptation%20&amp;amp;%20disaster%20risk%20reduction%20assessments/EEA%202017%20CCA-DRR%20Report/CLIM039/V2/CLIM039_2016_3.docx#_ftn6' title=''>[6]</a>. Once comparable national databases are available for all EU member states and EEA member countries and these data would be reported in future, this EEA indicator can be based on such data instead of data from Munich Re.</p> <p><b>Projections</b></p> <p>The IPCCAR5 concludes that high temperature extremes, heavy precipitation events and droughts will markedly increase in all or most world regions, including in Europe.

"assessment-1  Final energy consumption by sector and fuel    Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28. Final energy consumption decreased in all sectors, particularly in the industry and households sectors (16.5 % and 14.8 %, respectively), but also in the transport (4.5 %) and services sectors (1.7 %). This decrease in final energy consumption since 2005 was influenced by economic performance, structural changes in various end-use sectors, particularly industry, improvements in end-use efficiency and lower than average heat consumption as a result of favorable climatic conditions, particularly in 2011 and 2014. In 2014, the EU-28 met its 2020 target for final energy consumption.       Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption in some non-EU EEA countries, namely Turkey, Iceland and Norway, increased by 28 % (2.8 % per year). This difference was caused by an increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %), and a small decrease in energy consumption in Norway (1 %). Since 1990, the final energy consumption in these non-EU EEA countries has increased by 92 % (2.8 % annually).       Final energy consumption in the EEA-33 countries decreased by 8.4 % (1 % annually) between 2005 and 2014. The largest contributors to this decrease were the industry and household sectors, bothcontributing 13.6 % to this decrease. On average, each person in the EEA-33 countries used 2.0 tonnes of oil equivalent to meet their energy needs in 2014.    fuels energy consumption natural gas electricity ghg retrospective solid fuels energy cosumption electriciy energy         CSI CSI027 ENER ENER016 027 016,<ul> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28 (Figure 1) and by 8.4 % (1.0 % annually) in the EEA-33 countries. Between 2013 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased (see Table 1) by 4.1 % in the EU-28 and 3.5 % in the EEA-33 countries. The difference in the reduction in final energy consumption between the EEA-33 and the EU-28 is mainly as a result of the increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %) between 2005 and 2014. In Iceland, this increase was mainly caused by an increase in the production capacity of the aluminium industry. In Norway, final energy consumption decreased by 1 % between 2005 and 2014.</li> <li>With regard to final energy consumption per sector (see Figure 1), final energy consumption in the industry sector has decreased by 16.5 % in the EU-28 (13.6 % in the EEA-33) since 2005, in the household sector it has decreased by 14.8 % in the EU-28 (13.6 % in the EEA-33), in the transport sector it has decreased by 4.6 % in the EU-28 (1.6 % in the EEA-33), and in the 'Fishing, agriculture and forestry' and 'Non-specified' sectors it has decreased by 27.9 % in the EU-28 (22.5 % in the EEA-33). In the services sector, final energy consumption has decreased by 1.7 % in the EU-28 since 2005, but it has increased by 2.4 % in the EEA-33. Over the whole period (19902014), the largest increases in final energy consumption in the EU-28 occurred in the services and transport sectors, with increases of 30 % and 24 %, respectively (38 % and 28 %, respectively, in the EEA-33).</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the industry sector fell at an average annual rate of 2.0 %. This was largely the result of a shift towards less energy-intensive manufacturing industries and the continuing transition to a more service-oriented European economy, combined with the effects of the economic recession in recent years. This trend in decreasing energy consumption in industry is expected to continue in the future because of ongoing industry reallocation which could lead to a permanently smaller manufacturing sector in the EU.</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the services sector decreased annually by 0.2 %. This sector is growing in Europe and so is the demand for energy for electrical appliances, particularly those related to information and communication technologies, such as computers, and other energy-intensive technologies, such as heating and air conditioning. Overall, however, the energy consumption in this sector has been more or less stable.</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, energy consumption in the transport sector decreased annually by 0.5 %. This decrease, observed since 2007, was due to energy savings in road transport. This is the result of improvements in fuel efficiency, as a result of vehicle emission standards, which have been offset by increases in passenger and freight transport demand. Higher transport demand has resulted from an increase in the ownership of private cars, particularly in the new EU Member States, as well as an increase in settlement and urban sprawl which have led to people travelling longer distances, and changes in lifestyle. For more details on trends in the transport sector, see EEA, 2015a, and <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/ds_resolveuid/IND-113-en' class='external-link' target='_self'>TERM001</a>.</li> <li>In 2014, the transport sector accounted for 33 % of total final energy consumption in the EU-28 Member States, followed by the industrial sector (26 %), the household sector (25 %) and the services sector (13 %) (see Figure 1).</li> <li>The observed trend in final energy consumption differs significantly across the EEA member countries (see Table 1). Between 2005 and 2014, Iceland, Malta and Turkey experienced, by far, the largest increases in final energy consumption (78 %, 42 % and 35 %, respectively), whereas Greece and Spain experienced the largest decreases (26 % and 19 %, respectively). In addition, final energy consumption also decreased significantly in Hungary (18 %), Portugal (17 %), Italy (17 %), Ireland (15 %) and the United Kingdom (15 %) during this period. Large increases in final energy consumption correlate with growing economies (e.g. Turkey) and growing industry (e.g. Iceland). The decreases in final energy consumption are mainly the result of energy savings (in Ireland and the United Kingdom), in combination with a decrease in economic activity (Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain).</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of oil decreased by 16.1 % (1.9 % annually) (see Figures 2 and 6). The largest decrease, of 45.1 %, was in the industry sector. The smallest decrease, of 7.8 %, occurred in the transport sector.</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, the final consumption of electricity decreased by 2.8 % (0.3 % annually) (see Figures 3 and 6). Since 2005, electricity consumption in the services sector continued to increase (by 10 %), while, over the same period, electricity consumption decreased by 12 % in the industry sector and 2 % in the household sector. Electricity consumption in industry decreased mainly because of a decrease in activity in the sector and an increase in energy savings. The consumption of electricity in the household sector has been more or less stable since 2005. An increase in the number of dwellings has been balanced by an increase in the energy efficiency of lighting, electrical appliances, and electrical heating and cooling systems. The increase in the consumption of electricity in the services sector is because of the Europe-wide growth of the sector.</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of natural gas decreased by 18.6 % (2.3 % annually) (see Figures 4 and 6). Natural gas consumption in the households and services sectors has, on average, decreased as a result of improvements in the thermal performance of buildings, but this has been offset, to a certain extent, by an increase in the number of houses and buildings. Between 2005 and 2014, natural gas consumption decreasedby 22.1 % in the household sector and 5.3 % in the services sector. In 2014, the household sector accounted for the largest proportion of the final energy consumption of natural gas (42 %) in the EU-28. This was a result of the increase in the use of gas for residential heating and cooking. Consequently, the trend in natural gas consumption shows relatively large year-to-year variations due to weather conditions: natural gas consumption increased in 2010 because of cold winter conditions and decreased in 2011 and 2014because of mild winter conditions.</li> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, the consumption of solid fuels decreased by 13.7 % (1.6 % annually) (see Figures 5 and 6). In absolute terms, this reduction occurred mainly in the industry sector. The decrease of solid fuel consumption in the households sector stopped in 2000. However, year-to-year variations occur because of weather conditions.</li> </ul>","Final energy consumption by sector and fuel",,"Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28.

"assessment  Wind storms     Storm location, frequency and intensity have shown considerable decadal variability across Europe over the past century, such that no significant long-term trends are apparent.   Recent studies on changes in winter storm tracks generally project an extension eastwards of the North Atlantic storm track towards central Europe and the British Isles.   Climate change simulations show diverging projections on changes in the number of winter storms across Europe. However, most studies agree that the risk of severe winter storms, and possibly of severe autumn storms, will increase for the North Atlantic and northern, north-western and central Europe over the 21st century.     europe climate change projection wind speed    CLIM CLIM005 005,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Studies of past changes in extra-tropical storms have used a variety of methods, making it difficult to compare the results of different studies or to assess if there is any underlying trend in climate change.

"assessment  Water- and food-borne diseases     It is not possible to assess whether past climate change has already affected water- and food-borne diseases in Europe, but the sensitivity of pathogens to climate factors suggest that climate change could be having effects on these diseases.   The number of vibriosis infections, which can be life-threatening, has increased substantially in Baltic Sea states since 1980. This increase has been linked to observed increases in sea surface temperature, which has improved environmental conditions for Vibrio species blooms in marine waters. The unprecedented number of vibriosis infections in 2014 has been attributed to the unprecedented 2014 heat wave in the Baltic region.   Increased temperatures could increase the risk of salmonellosis.   The risk of campylobacteriosis and cryptosporidiosis could increase in those regions where precipitation or extreme flooding is projected to increase.   Climate change can have an impact on food safety hazards throughout the food chain.     baltic sea climate change health infections    CLIM CLIM038 038,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Vibrio species (non-cholera)</strong></p> <p>Brackish water and elevated ambient temperature are ideal environmental growth conditions for certainVibriospecies. These conditions can be found during the summer months in estuaries and enclosed water bodies with moderate salinity, such as the Baltic Sea. In contrast, open ocean environments do not offer appropriate growth conditions for these bacteria owing to the high salt content, lower temperature and limited nutrient content. Of the most relevance to human health are theVibriospecies that can cause vibriosis infections, includingVibrio parahaemolyticus,Vibrio vulnificusand the non-toxigenicVibrio cholerae.</p> <p>Elevated levels of non-choleraVibriospecies infections have been observed during extended hot summer seasons with water temperatures above 20C in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. The availability of data is best for the Baltic Sea region, where a recent analysis found strong links between the temporal and spatial peaks in sea surface temperatures and the number and distribution of Vibrio infections. Figure 1 shows the observed and projected levels of Vibrio infections in the Baltic Sea region from 1982 to 2010, which was a period of unprecedented sea surface temperature warming <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Increased numbers of infections can be expected based on the effects of increased temperatures under climate change scenarios. Figure 2 presents Vibrio risk maps for 2006 (left) and 2050 under elevated sea surface temperature (right). The projected increase in risk is substantial, but the absolute increase is projected to be modest owing to low current incidence rates. More recent studies in this region suggest that this warming trend has continued, with the July 2014 heat wave experienced in Sweden and Finland leading to an unprecedented number of Vibrio wound infections reported in the region, many at extremely high latitudes (e.g. &gt;65N) <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Environmentally acquired Vibrio infections in humans associated with particularly high sea surface temperatures have also been reported along the North Sea coast of Europe in recent years <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>.</p> <p>Bacterial Vibrioblooms in coastal water can be monitored on the E3 Geoportal developed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. The tool uses daily updated remotely sensed data to examine environmentally suitable conditions forVibrio species in coastal waters internationally.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Cryptosporidium</strong></p> <p>Cryptosporidiosis is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by intracellular protozoan parasites, Cryptosporidiumspecies. Transmission is through the faecaloral route via contaminated water, soil or food products, and the most commonly identified vehicles are contaminated drinking water and contaminated recreational water. For example, several days of heavy rain in June 2013 resulted in river flooding in eastern Germany, and activities in the dried out floodplain led to infection among children <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. Heavy rainfall has also been associated with the contamination of water supplies and outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>, as the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in river water increases significantly during rainfall events. Dry weather conditions preceding a heavy rain event have also been associated with drinking water outbreaks <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. Thus, heavy precipitation can result in the persistence of oocysts in the water distribution system and the infiltration of drinking water reservoirs from springs and lakes. Inadequate barriers to remove or inactivate Cryptosporidium in the public water supply have in the past resulted in a large outbreak of Cryptosporidium in Sweden <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Campylobacter</strong></p> <p>In Europe, campylobacteriosis is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoeal disease. The association of campylobacteriosis with a number of weather-related factors, such as temperature, rainfall, humidity and sunshine is inconsistent and lacks a clear explanatory mechanism, as Campylobacterdoes not replicate outside its animal host. There is a clear seasonality to the data in a number of European countries, with more cases during the summer months, and an association with the ambient temperature that preceded the diagnosis of the cases by 10 to 14 weeks <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. Temperature has also been found to be linked to cases in a number of studies from England and Wales <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a> but not in other countries <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. Rain in early spring can trigger campylobacteriosis outbreaks <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>. With the projected increase in heavy rainfall events in northern Europe, the risk of surface and groundwater contamination is expected to rise. Climate change might increase the use of rainwater for irrigation or drinking water during times of drought in certain locations.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Norovirus</strong></p> <p>Norovirus is the most common cause of viral diarrhoea in humans with a pronounced winter seasonality. Food-borne norovirus outbreaks have been linked to climate and weather events; for example, heavy rainfall and floods may lead to wastewater overflow which can contaminate shellfish farming sites. Flood water has been associated with a norovirus outbreak in Austria <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. In Europe, norovirus season strength was positively associated with average rainfall in the wettest month <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. Water-borne transmission of the virus is probably influenced by rainfall, causing norovirus seasonality <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. The magnitude of rainfall has also been related to viral contamination of the marine environment and with peaks in diarrhoea incidence <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. The predicted increase of heavy rainfall events under climate change scenarios could lead to an increase in norovirus infections because floods are known to be linked to norovirus outbreaks.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Salmonella</strong></p> <p>Salmonellosis is the second most commonly reported gastrointestinal infection and an important cause of food-borne outbreaks in Europe. However, overall reported cases of salmonellosis have declined steadily for several years in Europe, in part because of control measures implemented in poultry production. An increase in weekly temperature has been associated with an increase in salmonellosis in different settings <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>. Seasonal temperatures have been linked to salmonellosis cases, but public health interventions can attenuate the effect of warmer temperature. Extreme precipitation events that result in faecal contamination events have also been associated with salmonellosis <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>. Floods caused by heavy rainfall events may disrupt water treatment and sewage systems and contribute to increased exposure toSalmonella species and other pathogens.</p> <p>Available climate change projections indicate that the average annual number of temperature-related cases of salmonellosis in Europe may increase by almost 20000 by the 2020s, in addition to increases expected from population changes. Under a high emissions scenario, climate change could result in up to 50% more temperature-related cases by the end of the 21st century than would be expected on the basis of population change alone. However, these estimates are associated with high uncertainty <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. Moreover, health promotion and food safety policies can mitigate adverse impacts on public health.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> C.

"assessment-2  Global and European sea level     Global mean sea level has risen by 19.5cm from 1901 to 2015, at an average rate of 1.7mm/year, but with significant decadal variation. The rate of sea level rise since 1993, when satellite measurements have been available, has been higher, at around 3mm/year. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993.   Evidence for a predominant role of anthropogenic climate change in the observed global mean sea level rise and for an acceleration during recent decades has strengthened since the publication of the IPCCAR5.   Most coastal regions in Europe have experienced an increase in absolute sea level and in sea level relative to land, but there is significant regional variation.   Extreme high coastal water levels have increased at most locations along the European coastline. This increase appears to be predominantly due to increases in mean local sea level rather than to changes in storm activity.   Global mean sea level rise during the 21st century will very likely occur at a higher rate than during the period 19712010. Process-based models considered in the IPCCAR5 project a rise in sea level over the 21st century that is likely in the range of 0.260.54m for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.450.81m for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). However, several recent studies suggest substantially higher values. Several national assessments, expert assessments and recent model-based studies have suggested an upper bound for 21st century global mean sea level rise in the range of 1.52.0m.   Available process-based models project that global mean sea level rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that peak and decline and do not exceed 500ppm CO 2 -equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO 2 -equivalent. However, these models are likely to systematically underestimate the sea level contribution from Antarctica, and some recent studies suggest substantially higher rates of sea level rise in the coming centuries.   The rise in sea level relative to land along most European coasts is projected to be similar to the global average, with the exception of the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic Coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound.   Projected increases in extreme high coastal water levels are likely to mostly be the result of increases in local relative mean sea level in most locations. However, recent studies suggest that increases in the meteorologically driven surge component can also play a substantial role, in particular along the northern European coastline.     greenland ice sheet climate change oceans antartic ice sheet sea level coast glaciers flooding extreme events         CSI CSI047 CLIM CLIM012 047 012,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends: extreme sea level along the European coastline</strong></p> <p>Producing a clear picture of either past changes or future projections of extreme high water levels for the entire European coastline is a challenging task because of the impact of local topographical features on surge events. While there are numerous studies for the North Sea coastline, fewer are available for the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, although this situation is starting to improve.</p> <p>Extreme sea levels show pronounced short- and long-term variability. A recent review of extreme sea level trends along European coasts concluded that long-term trends are mostly associated with the corresponding mean sea level changes. Changes in wave and storm surge climate mostly contribute to interannual and decadal variability, but do not show substantial long-term trends <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. When the contribution from local mean sea level changes and variations in tide are removed from the recent trends, the remaining effects of changes in storminess on extreme sea level are much smaller or even no longer detectable <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Additional studies are available for some European coastal locations, but these typically focus on more limited spatial scales <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. The only region where significant increases in storm surge height were found during the 20th century is the Estonian coast of the Baltic Sea <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>.</p> <p>In conclusion, while there have been detectable changes in extreme water levels around the European coastline, most of these are the result of changes in local mean sea level. The contribution from changes in storminess is currently small in most European locations and there is little evidence that any trends can be separated from long-term natural variability.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections: extreme sea level at the European coastline</strong></p> <p>Future projections of extreme sea level can be made using either process-based (dynamic) or empirical statistical modelling of storm surge behaviour driven by the output of global climate models <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. Uncertainty in these projections for Europe remains high and is ultimately linked to the uncertainty in future mid-latitude storminess changes. This is an area where current scientific understanding is advancing quickly, as climate model representations of aspects of Northern Hemisphere storm track behaviour are showing improvements associated with, for instance, greater ocean and atmosphere resolution. However, the newest global climate models have not yet, typically, been downscaled to suitably fine scales and used in studies of future storm surges <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>.</p> <p>It has generally been expected that projected increases in extreme sea level along the European coast during the upcoming decades will mostly be the result of mean sea level changes rather than changes in wave and storm surge climate <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. However, several recent studies suggest that changes in wave and storm surge climate may also play a substantial role in sea level changes during the 21st century in some regions. One recent study based on a multi-model ensemble projects an increase in storm surge level for most scenarios and return periods along the northern European coastline, which is more prominent for RCP8.5 than for RCP 4.5, and which can exceed 30% of the relative sea level rise. Storm surge levels along most European coastal areas south of 50N showed small changes <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. Similar results were obtained by another study, which found that increases in storm surges can contribute significantly to the projected increases of the 50-year flood height in north-western Europe, particularly along the European mainland coast <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. Sea level rise may also change extreme water levels by altering the tidal range. Tidal behaviour is particularly responsive in resonant areas of the Bristol Channel and the Gulf of Saint-Malo (with large amplitude decreases) and in the south-eastern German Bight and Dutch Wadden Sea (with large amplitude increases) <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>.</p> <p>The frequency of flooding events is estimated to increase by more than a factor of 10 in many European locations, and by a factor of more than 100 in some locations (Figure6) for the RCP4.5 scenario <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>. Large changes in flood frequency mean that what is an extreme event today may become the norm by the end of the century in some locations. A 10cm rise in sea level typically causes an increase by about a factor of three in the frequency of flooding to a given height. However, for any particular location, it is important to look in detail at the change in the height of flood defences that might be required. Where the flood frequency curve is very flat, modest increases in flood defences be sufficient. Where the flood frequency curve is steeper, larger increases in protection height or alternative adaptation, including managed retreat, might be needed.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> Ralf Weisse et al., Changing Extreme Sea Levels along European Coasts,Coastal Engineering, Coasts@Risks: THESEUS, a new wave in coastal protection, 87 (May 2014): 414, doi:10.1016/j.coastaleng.2013.10.017.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref2' title=''>[ii]</a> Melisa Menndez and Philip L.

Many tide gauge measurements have long multi-decade time series, with some exceeding more than 100years. However, the results can be distorted by various local effects. Satellite altimeters enable sea level to be measured from space and give much better spatial coverage (except at high latitudes). However, the length of the altimeter record is limited to only about two decades.</p> <p>The IPCCAR5 estimated that GMSL rose by 19.5cm in the period between 1901 and 2015, which corresponds to an average rate of around 1.7mm/year (Figure1). This rate is somewhat higher than the sum of the known contributions to sea level rise over this period <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. This value has been confirmed by more recent studies <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. One reanalysis suggests that GMSL during the 20th century rose at a lower rate of 1.20.2mm/year <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>, but this reanalysis has been criticised for its non-representative selection of tide gauges <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Evidence from formal detection and attribution studies showing that most of the observed increase in GMSL since the 1950s can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change has increased since the publication of the IPCCAR5 <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>.</p> <p>All estimates for the rate of GMSL rise during the period since 1993, for which satellite-based measurements are available, are considerably higher than the 20th century trend, at 2.63.2mm/year <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. Different statistical methods for assessing sea level trends and changes therein can come to somewhat different conclusions <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. However, available assessments agree that an acceleration in the rate of GMSL rise since the early 1990s is detectable, despite significant decadal variation. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993 <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>.</p> <p>The causes of GMSL rise over recent decades are now reasonably well understood. Thermal expansion and melting of glaciers account for around 75% of the measured sea level rise since 1971. The contribution from melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has increased since the early 1990s. Changes in land water storage have made only a small contribution, but the rate of groundwater extraction has increased recently and now exceeds the rate of storage in reservoirs <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. A recent study concludes that climate-driven variability in precipitation has resulted in increased water storage on land, and that global sea level rise in the period 20022014 would have been 1520% higher in the absence of this climate variability <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends: mean sea level along the European coastline</strong></p> <p>Sea level measurements for the European region are available from satellite altimeter observations (Figure2) and from tide gauges (Figure3). Satellite observations, which show changes in absolute sea level, are available from 1993. Tide gauge records can be more than 100years long; they show changes in relative sea level considering also land changes, which is more relevant for coastal protection than absolute sea level. Most European coastal regions experience increases in both absolute and relative sea level, but there are sizeable differences between the rates of absolute and relative sea level change across Europe.</p> <p>Figure2 shows linear trends in absolute sea level from 1992 to 2014 as observed by satellites. The main differences between regional seas and basins are primarily the result of different physical processes being the dominant cause of sea level change at different locations. For instance, the Mediterranean Sea is a semi-closed, very deep basin, exchanging water with the Atlantic Ocean through only the narrow Gibraltar Strait. Salinity in the Mediterranean Sea may increase in the future and this will tend to offset rises in sea level due to thermal expansion from warming. The NAO, interannual wind variability, changes in ocean circulation patterns, and the location of large-scale gyres and small-scale eddies are further factors that can influence local sea level in the European seas. Obviously, sea level changes in coastal zones are most relevant for society.</p> <p>Figure3 shows linear trends in relative sea level from 1970 to 2014 as observed by tide gauge stations in Europe. These trends can differ from those measured by satellites because of the longer time period covered and because tide gauge measurements are influenced by vertical land movement whereas satellite measurements are not. In particular, since the last ice age, the lands around the northern Baltic Sea have been, and are still, rising owing to the post-glacial rebound <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>.</p> <p><strong>Projections: global mean sea level</strong></p> <p>Currently, there are two main approaches to projecting future sea level. Process-based models represent the most important known physical processes explicitly, whereas empirical statistical models look at the relationship between temperature (or radiative forcing) and sea level that has been observed in the past and extrapolate it into the future. A significant recent step forwards in projecting future sea levels is the improved understanding of the contributing factors to recently observed sea level rise, which has increased confidence in the use of process-based models for projecting the future <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>.</p> <p>The IPCCAR5 concludes that the rate of GMSL rise during the 21st century will very likely exceed the rate observed in the period 19712010 for all emissions scenarios. Process-based models estimate the rise in GMSL for the period 20812100, compared with 19862005, to be likely in the range of 0.260.54m for RCP2.6, 0.320.62m for RCP4.5, 0.330.62m for RCP6.0 and 0.450.81m for RCP8.5. For RCP8.5, the rise in GMSL by 2100 is projected to be in the range of 0.530.97m, with a rate during 20812100 of 715mm/year. Based on current understanding, only a collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (i.e. those areas where the bed lies well below sea level and the edges flow into floating ice shelves) could cause GMSL to rise substantially (by up to several tenths of a metre) above the likely range projected for the 21st century, but the evidence is insufficient for estimating the likelihood of such a collapse (Figure4). Projections of sea level rise from recent empirical statistical models calibrated with newly available sea level reconstructions align with those from current process-based models <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p>Some recent studies highlight the contributions to recent sea level rise from ice sheet melting that were not included in the process-based models underlying the AR5 estimates above <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. A broad expert assessment of future sea level rise resulted in higher estimates than those from the process-based models reviewed in the AR5. The best expert estimates for sea level rise during the 21st century were 0.40.6m for the low forcing scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.71.2m for the high forcing scenario (RCP8.5) <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. Similar results were derived in other recent studies <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. A study that combined the model-based assessments from the AR5 with updated models and probabilistic expert assessment of the sea level contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets suggests an upper limit for GMSL rise during the 21st century of 180cm, which has a 5% probability of being exceeded under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. Various national reports have also used values in the range of 1.52.0m as upper estimates for GMSL rise during the 21st century. One recent study suggests that ice sheet melting in Antarctica and Greenland could occur much faster than previously assumed, which would result in sea level rise of several metres during the 21st century <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>, but these findings have been controversial. These high-end scenarios are somewhat speculative, but their consideration is nevertheless important for long-term coastal risk management, in particular in densely populated coastal zones <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>.</p> <p>Sea level rise will continue far beyond 2100. Based on a limited number of available simulations with process-based models, the AR5 suggests that the GMSL rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that do not exceed 500ppm CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent. However, the AR5 also considered it likely that the underlying models systematically underestimate Antarcticas future contribution to sea level rise <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. Estimates for GMSL rise beyond 2100 from the above-mentioned expert assessment are broadly comparable <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>. A more recent study suggests that melting of the Antarctic ice sheet alone could lead to sea level rise of more than 15m by 2500 under a high emissions scenario <a href='#_edn22' title=''>[xxii]</a>.</p> <p>On a multi-millennial time scale, projections based on process-based models suggest a quasi-linear GMSL rise of 13m per degree of global warming for sustained warming over a period of 2000 years. Significantly higher estimates for GMSL rise on multi-millennial time scales, of up to 50m over 10000 years for a high emissions scenario, have been derived from the geological record <a href='#_edn23' title=''>[xxiii]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections: mean sea level along the European coastline</strong></p> <p>Regional and local sea levels differ from the global mean owing to large-scale factors such as non-uniform changes in ocean density and changes in ocean circulation. Furthermore, disintegrating land-ice affects sea level differentially because of gravitational effects and the viscoelastic response of the lithosphere <a href='#_edn24' title=''>[xxiv]</a>. Sea level is also affected by changes in atmospheric loading (the inverse barometer effect) and vertical land movement. While there remains considerable uncertainty in the spatial patterns of future sea level rise, around 70% of the worlds coastlines are expected to experience a local mean sea level change within 20% of the projected GMSL change <a href='#_edn25' title=''>[xxv]</a>.</p> <p>Relative sea level change along most of the European coastline is projected to be reasonably similar to the global average. The main exceptions are the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound. As a result, sea level relative to land in these regions is rising slower than elsewhere or may even decrease (Figure5) <a href='#_edn26' title=''>[xxvi]</a>. A probabilistic assessment of regional sea-level rise in northern Europe reported central estimates of relative sea level change during the 21st century for the RCP8.5 emissions scenario from 14cm (in Lule, northern Sweden) to 84 cm in Den Helders (Netherlands); high estimates (with a 5% probability to be exceeded) range from 52cm to 181cm, respectively <a href='#_edn27' title=''>[xxvii]</a>.</p> <p>A recent review study estimated that 21st century sea level rise along the Dutch coast would be in the range of 25 to 75cm for a low warming scenario and 50 to 100cm for a high warming scenario (year 2100, compared with the 19862005 baseline period) <a href='#_edn28' title=''>[xxviii]</a>. Making regional projections for relatively small isolated and semi-closed ocean basins, such as the Mediterranean or the Baltic, is even more difficult than for the open ocean.</p> <p>Sea level rise substantially increases the risk of coastal flooding, which affects people, communities and infrastructure. For example, the ClimateCost and PESETAII projects have estimated that a 30cm sea level rise by the end of the 21st century, in the absence of public adaptation, would more than triple annual damages from coastal floods in the EU from EUR5 to 17billion <a href='#_edn29' title=''>[xxix]</a>. These potential impacts can be substantially reduced by timely adaptation measures, but they are associated with significant costs <a href='#_edn30' title=''>[xxx]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> J.

The rate of sea level rise since 1993, when satellite measurements have been available, has been higher, at around 3mm/year. Global mean sea level in 2015 was the highest yearly average over the record and ~70 mm higher than in 1993.   Evidence for a predominant role of anthropogenic climate change in the observed global mean sea level rise and for an acceleration during recent decades has strengthened since the publication of the IPCCAR5.   Most coastal regions in Europe have experienced an increase in absolute sea level and in sea level relative to land, but there is significant regional variation.   Extreme high coastal water levels have increased at most locations along the European coastline. This increase appears to be predominantly due to increases in mean local sea level rather than to changes in storm activity.   Global mean sea level rise during the 21st century will very likely occur at a higher rate than during the period 19712010. Process-based models considered in the IPCCAR5 project a rise in sea level over the 21st century that is likely in the range of 0.260.54m for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 0.450.81m for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). However, several recent studies suggest substantially higher values. Several national assessments, expert assessments and recent model-based studies have suggested an upper bound for 21st century global mean sea level rise in the range of 1.52.0m.   Available process-based models project that global mean sea level rise by 2300 will be less than 1m for greenhouse gas concentrations that peak and decline and do not exceed 500ppm CO 2 -equivalent, but will be in the range of 1m to more than 3m for concentrations above 700ppm CO 2 -equivalent. However, these models are likely to systematically underestimate the sea level contribution from Antarctica, and some recent studies suggest substantially higher rates of sea level rise in the coming centuries.   The rise in sea level relative to land along most European coasts is projected to be similar to the global average, with the exception of the northern Baltic Sea and the northern Atlantic Coast, which are experiencing considerable land rise as a consequence of post-glacial rebound.   Projected increases in extreme high coastal water levels are likely to mostly be the result of increases in local relative mean sea level in most locations. However, recent studies suggest that increases in the meteorologically driven surge component can also play a substantial role, in particular along the northern European coastline.","2016-12-20T16:53:51Z","2016-12-20T16:53:59Z","Sweden,Spain,Iceland,United Kingdom,France,Norway,Netherlands,Greece,Germany,Belgium,Lithuania,Croatia,Finland,Italy","Marine Artic Ocean,Norwegian Sea,Baltic Sea,Marine Black sea,North Sea,Ionian Sea,Marine Mediterranean sea,Earth,Bay of Biscay,Aegean Sea,Marine North-east Atlantic ocean,North Atlantic Ocean,Mediterranean Sea,Alboran Sea,Celtic Sea,Marine North sea,Adriatic Sea,Black Sea,Marine Baltic sea,Iberian Sea","published","Coasts and seas,Climate change adaptation","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/sea-level-rise-4/assessment-2","Indicator assessment","2047,2059,1991,1895,1992,1883,2010,2022,1900,2034,2046,1936,1948,1912,1924,2090,2036,2048,1980,1896,1884,1981,1993,2011,2023,2035,1925,1937,1901,1913,2091,1949,2069,1892,1880,1893,2020,1910,2032,1922,2044,2056,2068,1958,1934,1946,2058,1881,1990,1894,1882,2021,1911,2033,2045,2057,1947,1959,1923,1935,1890,2030,2042,2054,1932,2066,1944,2078,1920,1956,1968,1891,2031,1921,2043,1933,2055,2067,2079,1969,1945,1957,2009,2040,2052,2064,1954,2076,1966,2088,1930,1942,1978,2041,2053,2065,1943,2077,1955,2089,1931,1967,1979,2007,2019,2050,1940,2062,2074,2086,1976,2098,1988,1952,1964,1908,1909,2008,2051,2063,2075,1965,2087,1977,2099,1941,1953,1989,2005,2017,2029,2072,1950,1962,2084,2096,1889,1998,1974,1986,1918,1906,2060,2006,2018,2061,2073,1951,2085,2097,1987,1999,1963,1975,1907,1919,2003,2015,2027,2039,1972,2094,1984,1960,1899,1887,1996,2002,1904,1916,2070,1928,2082,2004,2016,2028,1961,2083,1973,2095,1888,2100,1985,1997,1929,1905,1917,2071,2025,2037,2049,1994,1885,1970,1982,2000,2012,2024,1897,1914,1926,1902,2080,2092,1938,2014,2026,2038,1983,1995,1971,1898,2001,1886,2013,1903,1915,2081,1927,2093,1939","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

The largest absolute decrease occurred in northern and north-western Europe.   The number of population-weighted cooling degree days (CDD) increased by 49.1 % between the 19511980 and 19812014 periods; the increase during the period 19812014 was on average 1.2 HDDs per year (1.9 % per year). The largest absolute increase occurred in southern Europe.   The projected decrease in HDDs as a result of future climate change during the 21st century is somewhat larger than the projected increase in CDDs in absolute terms.

In principle, HDD and CDD values can be added together to give a new indicator, energy degree days, which has shown a decrease since the 1950s. However, one must consider that HDDs and CDDs are climatological parameters and that the energy demand linked to their values is not the same, as heating and cooling systems are often based on different technologies.</p> <p>Figure 1 highlights some important features of the evolution of the pattern of HDDs and CDDs in Europe since the 1950s. In the first three decades, HDDs were roughly constant and CDDs declined slightly. Since the beginning of the 1980s, Europe has started experiencing a markedly declining overall trend in HDDs, and a markedly increasing trend in CDDs, pointing to a general increase in cooling needs and a general decrease in heating needs. Figure 2 shows that the decrease in HDDs has been particularly strong in the Alpine areas and the Baltic and Scandinavian countries, whereas the increase in CDDs is particularly strong in southern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in the Balkan countries. Some overlapping of medium to strong HDD and CDD effects is noticeable in Bulgaria, southern France, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Temperatures in Europe are projected to continue to increase. Hence, the trend of a decreasing number of HDDs and an increasing number of CDDs is very likely to continue, and most likely to accelerate <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Model simulations performed in the ClimateCost project (based on HDD and CDD data) have estimated the decrease in residential heating energy demand in the EU as a result of climate change alone (above the SRES A1B baseline without climate change) to be 28 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe)/year by 2050 and 65Mtoe/year by 2100; the corresponding projected increase in cooling energy demand is 16Mtoe/year by 2050 and 53Mtoe/year by 2100. While the projected physical energy reductions for heating are higher than the increase in cooling demand, in economic terms the projected reduction in total heating demand is about the same as the increase in cooling demand, as cooling is more expensive than heating. In cold countries, such as Norway, the net effect of projected temperature increases reduces total energy demand, whereas in warm countries, such as Spain, it increases energy demand.

"assessment  Crop water demand     Climate change led to an increase in the crop water demand and thus the crop water deficit from 1995 to 2015 in large parts of southern and eastern Europe; a decrease has been estimated for parts of north-western Europe.   The projected increases in temperature will lead to increased evapotranspiration rates, thereby increasing crop water demand across Europe. This increase may partly be alleviated through reduced transpiration at higher atmospheric CO 2  levels.   The impact of increasing water requirements is expected to be most acute in southern and central Europe, where the crop water deficit and irrigation requirements are projected to increase. This may lead to an expansion of irrigation systems, even in regions currently without irrigation systems. However, this expansion may be constrained by projected reductions in water availability and increased demand from other sectors and for other uses.     crops climate change crop water requirement grain maize crop water deficit     CLIM CLIM033 033,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Irrigation in Europe is currently concentrated along the Mediterranean, where in some countries more than 80% of the total freshwater abstraction is used for agricultural purposes <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. However, consistent observations of water demand and consumption for agriculture do not currently exist for Europe, partly because of unrecorded water abstractions and national differences in accounting and reporting. Modelling approaches can be used to compute net irrigation requirements. Two studies estimated the net irrigation requirements in Europe for 19952002 and for the year 2000 with a total of three different model systems <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. The results show an irrigation requirement of up to 2140km<sup>3</sup> for Spain, which had the highest net irrigation requirement in the EU-27.</p> <p>Crop water demand, defined as the water consumed during the growing season, depends on the crop type and the timing of the growing season. Water demand can be modelled using meteorological data and information on crop management, and the difference between crop water demand and rainfall constitutes the crop water deficit. Figure 1 shows the change in the crop water deficit for grain maize, which is a crop that is often grown under irrigated conditions because it is mostly grown during the summer season. The hatched areas in Figure 1 show the areas where crop water demand exceeds average rainfall and thus may have an irrigation demand. The trends for 19952015 show an increase in the crop water deficit for maize in large parts of southern and eastern Europe; a decrease has been estimated for parts of north-western Europe.</p> <p>Some of the effects of estimated changes in the crop water deficit may also be related to the duration of the crop growing period, which is shortened under higher temperatures, thus leading to less water being consumed.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>A multi-model study using seven global hydrological models driven by five global climate models under four RCP scenarios estimated changes in irrigation water demand (IWD) across regions during the 21st century. Under the low and low-to-medium emissions scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, respectively), the simulated changes in IWD across Europe were small. For RCP6.0, the multi-model average suggests a substantial increase in IWD in most of Europe. For RCP8.5, the projected increase in IWD exceeds 25% in most of the irrigated regions in Europe <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Most hydrological models in this multi-model study did not consider the physiological effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub>, which can increase the water-use efficiency of crop plants. The only available study using a hydrological and a crop model that considers the physiological effect of increased CO<sub>2</sub> still estimates that there is a high likelihood that IWD in southern Europe will increase by more than 20% until 2080 <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Regional case studies suggest much higher increases in IWD in some regions <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>.</p> <p>Climate change will also affect water availability. The Mediterranean area is projected to experience a decline in water availability, and future irrigation will be constrained by reduced run-off and groundwater resources, by demand from other sectors and by economic costs <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. Assuming that urban water demands would be prioritised over agricultural purposes, the proportional reduction of water availability for irrigation in many European basins is larger than the reduction in annual run-off <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>.</p> <p>The projected changes in the crop water deficit for grain maize are shown in Figure 2 for two different climate models. The simulations are based on the WOFOST crop model, which considers the effect of increases in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations on the water use efficiency of maize. The simulations for both climate model projections for the 2030s show an increasing crop water deficit for large areas of Europe, in particular over central Europe. This will increase the water requirement for irrigation, including in areas not currently applying irrigation.</p> <p>Adaptation measures and the integrated management of water, often at catchment scale, are needed to address future competing demands for water between agriculture, energy, conservation and human settlements.

"assessment  Water-limited crop yield     Yields of several rainfed crops are levelling off (e.g. wheat in some European countries) or decreasing (e.g. grapes in Spain), whereas yields of other crops (e.g. maize in northern Europe) are increasing. These changes are attributed partly to observed climate change, in particular warming.   Extreme climatic events, including droughts and heat waves, have negatively affected crop productivity in Europe during the first decade of the 21st century.   Future climate change could lead to both decreases and increases in average yield, depending on the crop type and the climatic and management conditions in the region. There is a general pattern of projected increases in productivity in northern Europe and reductions in southern Europe, but with differences between crop types.   Projected increases in extreme climatic events are expected to increase crop yield variability and to lead to yield reductions in the future throughout Europe.     wheat climate change agriculture crop yield    CLIM CLIM032 032,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>A global analysis of yields of cereal crops (wheat, maize and barley) has shown that increasing mean temperatures in recent decades have had a negative effect on yield <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Similar effects have been observed for various countries in Europe <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Increasing temperatures have been identified as one of the main causes of the lack of yield increase in winter wheat in France, despite improvements in crop breeding <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Grain yields in southern Europe seem to have been levelling off. There is also a tendency for an increasing variability of grain yields in France and Italy, linked to the occurrence of heat waves and droughts <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Similar effects of heat haves and droughts have been observed globally, whereas floods and intense rainfall have not been seen to affect overall crop production <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. In Italy and southern-central Europe, the potential crop yields of potato, wheat, maize and barley significantly decreased over the time period 19762005 owing to temperature and radiation change effects <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. In north-east Spain, grape yield has been declining because of increasing water deficits since the 1960s <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. Droughts and heat waves affected the crop production in large areas of southern and central Europe in 2003 and 2007 <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. An increase in climate-induced variability in maize yield has been observed over recent decades in France <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>.</p> <p>Climate change has also shown positive effects on yields. Potato and sugar beet have responded positively to increasing temperatures through an increase in yields, most likely due to the longer growing seasons <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. In Scotland, increasing temperatures are estimated to have increased the potential potato yield by up to 39% over the period 19602006 <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>. In parts of the UK and parts of northern-central Europe, the yield potential of wheat, sugar beet and maize has increased since 1976 <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. Grain yields in maize have been steadily increasing in northern Europe, most likely linked to the warmer climate <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>The impact of future changes in climate on crop yield depends on the characteristics of the climatic change within a region, as well as on a combination of other environmental, economic, technological and management factors <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. A broad analysis of climate change scenarios for agricultural productivity in Europe has provided a clear picture of deterioration of agroclimatic conditions through increased drought stress and a shortening of the active growing season across large parts of southern and central Europe <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. Other studies suggest an increasing number of unfavourable years for agricultural production in many European climatic zones, limiting winter crop expansion and increasing the risk of cereal yield loss <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>.</p> <p>Dynamic crop models may be used to evaluate the effect of climate change on crop production, provided that the model is tested for the accuracy of its response to various climate change factors <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. Figure 1 shows projected changes in water-limited winter wheat yields in Europe for the 2030s (compared with the 2000s) for climate projections from two different climate models (HadGEM2-ES) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM) using the WOFOSTcrop model. The top row of the map shows the results when the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is assumed to be that of the 2000s, whereas the bottom row shows the results when the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation on crop growth was simulated. When no CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effect is taken into account, simulations using both climate models show a decrease in wheat yields over most of Europe, with the exception of some northern areas. When the CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effect is taken into account, model simulations generally show a yield increase in most areas, with the notable exception of central Europe for one climate model (HadGEM2). The simulated moderate yield reduction over central Europe for this model indicates that increased CO<sub>2</sub> does not compensate for unfavourable climatic conditions, such as prolonged and more intense droughts. These simulations did not include adaptations to climate change, such as changes in crop species and crop management, owing to the inherent complexity of agricultural systems. Therefore, the projected yields in 2030 may be slightly underestimated. A study on the potential effectiveness by 2040 of adaptation by farmers in southern and central Europe suggests that the adaptation potential to future warming is large for maize but limited for wheat and barley <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>.</p> <p>Future crop yield developments are subject to considerable uncertainty, in particular with regard to climate projections and the magnitude of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilisation effects in practice. For example, Figure 1 does not consider all of the main sources of uncertainty, as only two climate models and one crop model have been used to produce the simulations. A wider variation would have been found if more climate model projections and more crop models had been used. A large proportion of the uncertainty in climate change impact projections for crop yields are the result of variations among different crop models rather than the variations among the downscaled climate projections <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>. Uncertainties in simulated impacts increase with higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations and associated warming.</p> <p>Figure 2 provides an aggregated picture of the expected changes in crop yields across Europe by considering three crops, an ensemble of 12 GCMs and the current irrigated area. These estimates include the effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration on crop yield. The regional pattern of projected impacts is clear, generally showing improved conditions in northern Europe and worse conditions in southern Europe.</p> <p>Despite the above-mentioned uncertainties, there is a clear indication of deteriorating agroclimatic conditions in terms of increased drought stress and a shortening of the active growing season in central and southern Europe <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. There is a risk of an increasing number of extremely unfavourable years, which might lead to higher interannual variability in crop yield and constitute a challenge for proper crop management. Some of the climate-related risk factors, such as high temperature stress, flooding and adverse sowing and harvesting conditions, are included only to a limited extent in current crop models, such as those used for the projections in Figure 1. Figure 3 shows that the frequency of adverse agroclimatic conditions for wheat is projected to increase substantially across Europe under climate change, with the largest risks generally experienced in southern parts of Europe. These increases in extreme events may severely restrict the efficiency of adaptations to climate change, including the shifting of wheat production to other regions as the risk of adverse events beyond the key wheat-growing areas increases even more <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> David B Lobell and Christopher B Field, Global Scale Climatecrop Yield Relationships and the Impacts of Recent Warming,Environmental Research Letters 2 (March 2007): 014002, doi:10.1088/1748-9326/2/1/014002.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref2' title=''>[ii]</a> P.

The flowering date for winter wheat was projected to show the greatest advance in western parts of Europe, with an advance of up to two weeks by 2050. The projected advance in the date of reaching maturity is greater than the advance in flowering date, leading to a shortening of the grain-filling period, which will negatively affect yields. One of the main adaptation options to cope with the shortening of crop growth phases is choosing crop cultivars that have higher thermal requirements, as this will reduce the negative yield effects of a shorter growth duration.

"assessment  Growing season for agricultural crops     The thermal growing season for agricultural crops in Europe has lengthened by more than 10 days since 1992. The delay in the end of the growing season has been more pronounced than the advance of the start of the season. The length of the growing season has increased more in northern and eastern Europe than in western and southern Europe.   The growing season is projected to increase further throughout most of Europe owing to the earlier onset of growth in spring and later senescence in autumn.   The projected lengthening of the thermal growing season would allow a northwards expansion of warm-season crops to areas that were not previously suitable.

"assessment  Vector-borne diseases     The transmission cycles of vector-borne diseases are sensitive to climatic factors, but disease risks are also affected by factors such as land use, vector control, human behaviour, population movements and public health capacities.   Climate change is regarded as the principal factor behind the observed move of the tick species Ixodes ricinus  the vector of Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis in Europe  to higher latitudes and altitudes. Climate change is projected to lead to further northwards and upwards shifts in the distribution of Ixodes ricinus.   It is generally suspected that climate change has played (and will continue to play) a role in the expansion of other disease vectors, notably the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which can disseminate several diseases including dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and Phlebotomus species of sandflies, which transmit leishmaniasis.   The unprecedented upsurge in the number of human West Nile fever infections in the summer of 2010 in south-eastern Europe was preceded by extreme hot spells in this region. High temperature anomalies in July were identified as contributing factors to the recurrent outbreaks in the subsequent years.     climate chikungunya transmission diseases west nile fever climate change human health climate suitability       CLIM CLIM037 037,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends: tick-borne diseases</strong></p> <p>Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) are the two most important tick-borne diseases in Europe, both of which are transmitted primarily by Ixodes ricinus. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the EU, with a reported incidence of approximately 65000 cases per year. However, there is no standardised case definition or diagnosis for Lyme disease in Europe, so this number represents only a best estimate. The number of reported cases of TBE in the EU was 2560 during 2012. The mean annual reporting of TBE cases has increased by approximately 400% in European endemic areas over the past 30 years, although this is almost certainly the result of more robust detection methods and diagnosis <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>.</p> <p>A key determinant of the number of reported cases is the abundance of ticks, a factor which is sensitive to climatic variables, notably temperature and humidity. Currently,Ixodes ricinusis present across much of continental Europe (Figure 1). There have already been reports on the northerly migration of the tick species in Sweden <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>, and to higher altitudes in the Czech Republic and Austria <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Range shifts have also been observed in Germany and Norway <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>.</p> <p>A high incidence of tick-borne disease is correlated with mild winters and warm, humid summers in Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden, although this could be the result of climate effects on human behaviour <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. A high risk of Lyme disease has been associated with mild winters, high summer temperatures, low seasonal variation of temperatures and high scores on vegetation indices <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. There are considerable differences between the distribution of ticks and the observed incidence of TBE <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. It is not currently possible to assess the relative importance of climatic changes and of other factors influencing disease incidence, including vaccination coverage, tourism patterns, public awareness, distribution of rodent host populations and socio-economic conditions <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. There is limited evidence that other tick-borne diseases may be sensitive to climate change. Some models have suggested that the Mediterranean basin has become suitable for an expansion of CrimeanCongo haemorrhagic fever <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>, but demographic factors, farming practices and land-use change may be more important drivers <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. The distribution of Rickettsia has also expanded in recent years, but the reasons for this are not yet well understood <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>, and few if any recent studies have interrogated the links between rickettsia diseases and climate change.</p> <p><b>Past trends: mosquito-borne diseases</b></p> <p>Mosquito habitats are influenced by temperature, humidity and precipitation levels. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is an important vector in Europe for transmitting viral diseases, including Zika, chikungunya and dengue. The first record of its establishment was in Italy in 1990, and Aedes albopictusis now present in several EU countries and in some countries neighbouring the EU (Figure 2). It has substantially extended its range in recent years, aided by trade and travel. It is generally suspected that climate change has also played a role in this expansion, but the extent to which this is the case is unclear <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. The introduction and geographical expansion of the distribution of Aedes albopictus within Europe has coincided with favourable climatic suitability for the mosquito in the Balkans, Italy, France and Benelux and in western Germany, on the eastern coast of Spain and on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>. Other parts of Europe are also climatically suitable for Aedes albopictus, even if they have not recorded the presence of the vector (Figure 3) <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>.</p> <p>Mosquito-borne diseases have not been a substantial concern within Europe until recently. However, locally transmitted (i.e. autochthonous) outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue and even malaria have occurred in recent years <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. Several disease outbreaks transmitted by Aedes<del cite='mailto:Andreas%20Marx%20marxa' datetime='2016-11-15T11:55'>.</del> albopictus have been reported in Europe: chikungunya in Italy and in France in 2010, 2014 and 2015, as well as local transmissions of dengue in France and Croatia in 2010 <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. Heavy rainfall events may have increased the risk of the autochthonous transmission of chikungunya in France in 2014 by leading to a rapid rise in vector abundance <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. No autochthonous transmission of dengue has been reported in Europe since 2010.</p> <p>The risk of travellers importing Zika, dengue or chikungunya coincides with the seasons and locations of active Aedes albopictusin Europe <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>. With continued expansion of Aedes albopictus in continental Europe, the risk of further introduction and transmission of Zika, chikungunya and dengue will continue to exist. The risk of chikungunya introductions into Europe via returning travellers has probably increased following the large-scale outbreak of chikungunya that began in the Caribbean in late 2013 and has subsequently continued in many American countries <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>.</p> <p>Aedes albopictusis not the primary vector for dengue and, although some parts of Europe are currently climatically suitable to its primary vector (Aedesaegypti), the risk of significant dengue transmission in continental Europe is currently very low, providing that the vector remains unestablished and control measures are in place <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. Aedes aegypti has, however, been responsible for dengue outbreaks in European territories, such as the 2013 outbreak in Madeira, Portugal <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>.</p> <p>Malaria was largely eradicated in Europe in the second half of the 20th century. However, the malaria vectors (Anopheles mosquitos) are still present in much of the European Union, and a few sporadic cases of local transmission occur each year <a href='#_edn22' title=''>[xxii]</a>. The risk of malaria re-establishment in a particular region depends on climatic and ecological factors, as well as human vulnerabilities to infection. During 20092012, Greece experienced autochthonous malaria transmission; temperature and other environmental variables were identified as determinants of environmental suitability <a href='#_edn23' title=''>[xxiii]</a>. However, socio-economic development is a key mitigating factor of malaria risk <a href='#_edn24' title=''>[xxiv]</a>, which therefore remains very low throughout Europe.</p> <p>West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans can be quite severe, particularly among the elderly, but many other cases can go unnoticed (more than 60% are asymptomatic) and occur through mosquito (Culexspecies) bites. Cases can also be acquired through blood transfusion or organ, tissue and cell transplantations and, although rare, such cases have been reported <a href='#_edn25' title=''>[xxv]</a>. Since 2010, there have been annual outbreaks in south-eastern and eastern Europe, suggesting an endemic transmission cycle and thus a resurgent public health problem (Figure 4) <a href='#_edn26' title=''>[xxvi]</a>. Positive temperature anomalies from the monthly averages were the most important determinants of the 2010 WNV outbreak <a href='#_edn27' title=''>[xxvii]</a>. Over the subsequent years, other environmental drivers (besides temperature) were also identified as important, such as the state of vegetation, water bodies (modified normalised difference water index) and bird migratory routes <a href='#_edn28' title=''>[xxviii]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends: sandfly-borne diseases</strong></p> <p>Leishmaniasis is the most common disease transmitted by phlebotomine<b> </b>sandflies in Europe. The transmission of the two parasites responsible for this disease that are endemic in the EU (Leishmania infantum, causing visceral leishmaniasis, and Leishmania tropica, causing cutaneous leishmaniasis) is heavily influenced by temperature. Leishmania tropica occurs sporadically in Greece and neighbouring countries, while Leishmania infantum is endemic in the Mediterranean region of the EU. Sandfly vectors currently have wider distribution ranges than the parasites. The evidence for an impact of climate change on the distribution of the sandfly in Europe is scarce <a href='#_edn29' title=''>[xxix]</a>. Climate change was suggested as one possible reason for the observed northwards expansion of sandfly vectors in Italy <a href='#_edn30' title=''>[xxx]</a>. The contemporary risk for central Europe has been estimated to be low owing to temperature constraints on pathogen growth <a href='#_edn31' title=''>[xxxi]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections: tick-borne diseases</strong></p> <p>Cold temperatures appear to determine the altitudinal and latitudinal limits of Ixodes ricinus<a href='#_edn32' title=''>[xxxii]</a>. Thus, an expansion of the distribution range of ticks to higher altitudes and latitudes is projected, as milder winter temperatures, longer vegetation seasons and earlier onsets of summer appear and warmer temperatures occur, under the condition that their natural hosts (deer) would also shift their distribution <a href='#_edn33' title=''>[xxxiii]</a>. One climate projection model anticipates a 3.8% overall habitat expansion for Ixodes ricinus in Europe by 20402060, with expansion into higher altitudes and latitudes (notably Scandinavia and the Baltic countries) and a contraction in some areas including the Alps, the Pyrenees, the interior of Italy and north-western Poland <a href='#_edn34' title=''>[xxxiv]</a>. This aligns with other models of climate change that anticipate Ixodes ricinus range expansions under climate change scenarios <a href='#_edn35' title=''>[xxxv]</a>, but it has been acknowledged that many uncertainties exist in these models and that extrapolating the projected habitat range of ticks to generate projections of the incidence of tick-borne disease leads to additional uncertainties.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the incidence of TBE may shift to higher altitudes and latitudes along with the distribution of Ixodes ricinus, potentially increasing the risk in some parts of northern and central Europe, unless targeted vaccination programmes and TBE surveillance are introduced. Similarly, TBE risk is generally expected to decrease in southern Europe. Warmer winters may facilitate the expansion of Lyme disease to higher latitudes and altitudes, particularly in northern Europe, but it would decrease in the parts of Europe that are projected to experience increased droughts <a href='#_edn36' title=''>[xxxvi]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections: mosquito-borne diseases</strong></p> <p>Various studies have found that warm seasonal and annual temperature and sufficient rainfall provide favourable climatic conditions for Aedes albopictusin Europe <a href='#_edn37' title=''>[xxxvii]</a>. The climatic suitability for Aedes albopictus is projected to increase where climate models project warmer and wetter climates, such as south-eastern United Kingdom <a href='#_edn38' title=''>[xxxviii]</a>, the Balkans and central Europe, while suitability generally decreases where climate becomes drier, such as in some regions of Spain and Portugal <a href='#_edn39' title=''>[xxxix]</a>. This corresponds with a modelling study that demonstrated a general decline in habitat suitability in southern Europe and the Mediterranean area, and an increase in habitat suitability in northern and eastern European countries <a href='#_edn40' title=''>[xl]</a>.</p> <p>The risk of chikungunya may increase in Europe, particularly in those regions where the seasonal activity of Aedes albopictusaligns with the seasonality of endemic chikungunya infections abroad, thereby potentially increasing the risk of importation via travellers <a href='#_edn41' title=''>[xli]</a>. Models of chikungunya transmission in Europe under climate change scenarios have identified France, northern Italy and the Pannonian Basin (east-central Europe) as the areas at highest risk, with increases in the level of risk in much of western Europe, including the Benelux countries and Germany. In contrast, Mediterranean regions demonstrated a decreased risk, although the models suggested that they will mostly remain climatically suitable for chikungunya transmission (Figure 5) <a href='#_edn42' title=''>[xlii]</a>.<strong></strong></p> <p>A climate-related increase in the density or active season ofAedes albopictuscould lead to a small increase in the risk of dengue in Europe. The risk could also increase if the temperature increase facilitated the re-establishment ofAedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. Further modelling studies are required to assess whether climate change would increase or decrease the climatic suitability forAedes aegyptiin continental Europe.</p> <p>Some malaria models suggest that there will be increased suitability for malaria transmission in continental Europe under future climate change, but projected malaria impacts are highly sensitive to model design <a href='#_edn43' title=''>[xliii]</a>. Nevertheless, socio-economic development, land-use and public health control measures would most likely be sufficient to mitigate the risk of malaria at the fringes of its distribution, despite the likelihood of sporadic introductions of the parasite through global travel <a href='#_edn44' title=''>[xliv]</a>.</p> <p>Climate change has previously not been expected to have a significant impact on WNV transmission in Europe <a href='#_edn45' title=''>[xlv]</a>. However, climate change could influence the transmission of the virus by affecting the geographical distribution of vectors and pathogens, by changing the migratory patterns of bird populations and through changes in the life cycle of bird-associated pathogens. Temperature increases could also play a role. The WNV risk in Europe has been projected into 2025 and 2050, with July temperature projections under a medium emissions scenario (IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B), keeping other variables constant (e.g. state of vegetation, water bodies and bird migratory routes) <a href='#_edn46' title=''>[xlvi]</a>. The results reveal a progressive expansion of areas with an elevated probability for WNV infections, particularly at the edges of the transmission areas (Figure 6). Projections for 2025 show an increased probability of WNV infection in eastern Croatia, north-eastern Greece and north-western Turkey; high-risk areas will have expanded even more by 2050.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections: sandfly-borne diseases</strong></p> <p>Future climate change could have an impact on the distribution of leishmaniasis by affecting the abundance of vector species and parasite development. Recent modelling indicates that the central European climate will become increasingly suitable for Phlebotomus species of sandflies <a href='#_edn47' title=''>[xlvii]</a>. One modelling study concluded that, by the end of the 2060s, France, Germany, western Poland and southern United Kingdom could be colonised by sandfly species, principally Phlebotomus ariasi and Phlebotomus pernicious, while the entire Mediterranean Basin, Balkan Peninsula and Pannonian Basin would all be potentially climatically suitable habitats for many Phlebotomus species <a href='#_edn48' title=''>[xlviii]</a>. Such expansions of sandfly species would increase the risk of leishmaniasis, but may be somewhat constrained by the limited migration ability of sandflies. The risk of disease transmission may also decrease in some areas in southern Europe where climate conditions become too hot and dry for vector survival.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> J.

Climate change is projected to lead to further northwards and upwards shifts in the distribution of Ixodes ricinus.   It is generally suspected that climate change has played (and will continue to play) a role in the expansion of other disease vectors, notably the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), which can disseminate several diseases including dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and Phlebotomus species of sandflies, which transmit leishmaniasis.   The unprecedented upsurge in the number of human West Nile fever infections in the summer of 2010 in south-eastern Europe was preceded by extreme hot spells in this region.

"assessment  Extreme temperatures and health     Heat waves and extreme cold spells are associated with decreases in general population well-being and with increases in mortality and morbidity, especially in vulnerable population groups. Temperature thresholds for health impacts differ according to the region and season.   The number of heat extremes has substantially increased across Europe in recent decades. Heat waves have caused tens of thousands of premature deaths in Europe since 2000.   It is virtually certain that the length, frequency and intensity of heat waves will increase in the future. This increase will lead to a substantial increase in mortality over the next decades, especially in vulnerable population groups, unless adaptation measures are taken.   Cold-related mortality is projected to decrease owing to better social, economic and housing conditions in many countries in Europe. There is inconclusive evidence about whether or not the projected warming will lead to a further substantial decrease in cold-related mortality.     mortality temperatures temperature mortality   CLIM CLIM036 036,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>In large parts of Europe, summertime temperature records, which are associated with prolonged heat waves, have increased substantially in recent decades. The summer of 2003 broke temperature records in large parts of western Europe; temperature records were again broken in different parts of Europe during the summers of 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015 <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. The record warm summer of 2003 was an outstanding example of increased mortality during periods of extreme temperatures, with an estimated premature mortality of 70000 people in Europe <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. The heat waves of the summer of 2015 caused more than 3000 deaths in France alone <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>.</p> <p>The largest effect of heat has been observed among the elderly, but in some cities younger adults have also been affected <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Elderly people are more vulnerable to the effects of heat waves, owing, in part, to poorer physical health and the effects of cognitive impairment on the perception of heat-related health risk; this is the population considered most at risk of heat-related mortality <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. In addition to the elderly, those with chronic diseases and persons of lower socio-economic status also have a heightened risk of heat-related mortality <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. Furthermore, health risks during heat extremes are greater in people who are physically very active. This has importance for outdoor recreational activities, and it is especially relevant for the impacts of climate change on occupational health (e.g. for manual labourers) <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>.</p> <p>The above-mentioned multi-country global observational study found that (moderate) cold was responsible for a higher proportion of deaths than (moderate) heat. The study collected data for daily mortality, temperature and other confounding variables from Italy (11 cities, 19872010), Spain (51 cities, 19902010), Sweden (one county, 19902002), the United Kingdom (10 regions, 19932006) and other areas outside Europe <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. The results should be interpreted with caution when applied to other regions that were not included in the database.</p> <p>Figure 1 shows the overall cumulative exposureresponse curves for four European cities with the corresponding minimum mortality temperature and the cut-os used to define extreme temperatures. Risk increases slowly and linearly for cold temperatures below the minimum mortality temperature, although some locations (e.g. London and Madrid) showed a higher increase for extreme cold than others. Risk generally escalated quickly and non-linearly at high temperatures. Deaths attributable to extreme heat are roughly as frequent as those attributable to moderate heat, while those attributable to extreme cold are negligible compared with those caused by moderate cold <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. Other studies have estimated that 1.62.0% of total mortality in the warm season is attributable to heat; about 40% of these deaths occur on isolated hot days in periods that would not be classified as heat waves <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>.</p> <p>Comparison of these estimates should be made with caution, as not only the methods used to estimate the excess deaths, but also the exposures were different. The impact of high temperatures later in the summer is sometimes diminished after an early heat wave. In Europe, heat waves occurring in June result in relatively high mortality compared with those occurring later in the summer <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>.</p> <p>Synergistic effects between high temperature and air pollution (Particles in the atmosphere with a diameter of less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometres (PM<sub>10</sub>) and ozone) have been observed to have led to an increase in hospital admissions as a result of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Furthermore, long warm and dry periods, in combination with other factors, can lead to forest fires, which can also have severe health impacts <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>It is virtually certain that heat extremes will continue to become more frequent over most land areas in the future. The number of monthly heat records globally is projected to be more than 12 times as high under a medium global warming scenario by the 2040s as in a climate with no long-term warming <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>. The projected return period of extreme heat events, such as those experienced in 2003 in western Europe, will signicantly shorten. This increase in heat extremes will lead to a marked increase in heat-attributable deaths under future warming, unless adaptation measures are taken. Highly urbanised areas are projected to be at an increased risk of heat stress compared with surrounding areas. Projections of future heat effects on human health need to consider that the European population is projected to age, because elderly populations are especially vulnerable <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>.</p> <p>Several studies have estimated future heat-related mortality in Europe using similar methods and have arrived at largely comparable results, namely PESETA, ClimateCost and PESETAII <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>.</p> <p>The PESETA study estimates that, without adaptation and physiological acclimatisation, heat-related mortality in Europe would increase by between 60000 and 165000 deaths per year by the 2080s compared with the present baseline, with the highest impacts in southern Europe. The results vary across climate models and emissions scenarios, with high emissions scenarios leading to much higher heat-related mortality than low emissions scenarios. Heat-related mortality would be significantly lower under full acclimatisation if, for example, currently cool regions were able to achieve the temperaturemortality relationship of currently warm regions <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. The results from the PESETA II study confirm, to a large extent, the results of earlier assessments (in particular, those from the PESETA and ClimateCost projects), although with slightly higher impacts (both in physical and economic terms) <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. Comparable estimates were made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the WHO European Region <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>.</p> <p>Another study estimates that climate change will lead to an increase in hospital admissions owing to heat-related respiratory diseases from 11000 admissions (0.18%) in the period 19812010 to 26000 (0.4%) in 20212050. The total number of hospital admissions and the increase as a result of climate change are largest in southern Europe, with the proportion of heat-related admissions for respiratory conditions expected to approximately triple in this region over this time period <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>.</p> <p>The PESETA study estimated that cold-related mortality would decrease by between 60000 and 250000 deaths per year by the 2080s, which is about the same magnitude as the projected increase in heat-related mortality <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. The PESETA II study no longer considers a potential reduction in cold-related mortality in its climate impact estimates <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>. The choice not to include cold spells reflects recent evidence that does not suggest a significant shift in the balance of deaths between winters and summers because of lower cold-related mortality <a href='#_edn22' title=''>[xxii]</a>. However, the risk from (moderate) cold is expected to continue to account for most of the temperature-related risk throughout this century <a href='#_edn23' title=''>[xxiii]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> D.

"assessment  Floods and health     River and coastal flooding have affected many millions of people in Europe since 2000. Flooding affects human health through drowning, heart attacks, injuries, infections, exposure to chemical hazards and mental health consequences. Disruption of services, including health services, safe water, sanitation and transportation ways, plays a major role in vulnerability.   Observed increases in heavy precipitation and extreme coastal water levels have increased the risk of river and coastal flooding in many European regions.   In the absence of additional adaptation, the projected increases in extreme precipitation events and in sea level would substantially increase the health risks associated with river and coastal flooding in Europe.     floods climate deaths   CLIM CLIM046 046,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Most regions in Europe have exhibited an increasing trend in heavy precipitation over recent decades, in particular in winter. The number of large inland floods in Europe has been increasing since the 1980s; however, there is not yet conclusive evidence that climate change has already contributed to this trend <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>.</p> <p>Estimates for the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region based on a combination of data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) indicate that coastal and inland floods killed more than 2000 people and affected 8.7million in the period 20002014. Figure 1 shows the number of deaths related to flooding in each European Environment Agency (EEA) member and cooperating country for the same period, normalised by their population. The largest numbers are found in south-eastern Europe, eastern Europe and central Europe. Note that, because of the relatively short time period of 15years, the value of the indicator can be significantly affected by a single catastrophic event. For example, at least 50people were killed in massive floods in the Balkan countries in May 2014 <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>.</p> <p>The EM-DAT database also includes data on people injured or (otherwise) affected by floods.

"assessment  Forest fires     Fire risk depends on many factors, including climatic conditions, vegetation, forest management practices and other socio-economic factors.   The burnt area in the Mediterranean region increased from 1980 to 2000; it has decreased thereafter.   In a warmer climate, more severe fire weather and, as a consequence, an expansion of the fire-prone area and longer fire seasons are projected across Europe. The impact of fire events is particularly strong in southern Europe.     forest fires climate change impacts scenarios   CLIM CLIM035 035,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>The number and extent of forest fires vary considerably from one year to the next, depending on the seasonal meteorological conditions. Some multi-annual periodicity in the burned area trend can also be partially attributed to the dead biomass burning/accumulation cycle typical of the fire-prone regions. The historical trend of the number of fires is difficult to analyse because fire frequency is strongly affected by the significant changes that occurred in past years in the statistical reporting systems of the countries.</p> <p>Historical fire series are available in Europe and are regularly updated within the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). Data availability in EFFIS is not the same for all countries, and time series longer than 25 years are available for only a few countries. Figure 1 shows that the reported fire frequency in the five southern European countries for which long time series are available increased during the 1990s, then stabilised for around one decade, and slightly decreased during recent years. Note that these values cannot be compared across countries because of large differences across countries in the total area and the area at risk. In 2014, a large forest fire severely damaged more than 15000ha of forest land in Vstmanland County, Sweden <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Forest fires are also affecting new areas. For example, in 2007, wildfires moved to previously non-fire-prone ecosystems in southern Greece <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>.</p> <p>Past trends of fire danger have also been analysed by processing series of meteorological fire danger indices, which are routinely used to rate the fire potential owing to weather conditions. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) is used in EFFIS to rate the daily fire danger conditions in Europe <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Daily severity values can be averaged over the fire season obtaining a Seasonal Severity Rating (SSR) index. The index is dimensionless and allows objective comparison of fire danger from year to year and from region to region; SSR values above six may be considered in the extreme range.</p> <p>Figure 2 shows the current state, past trend and projections for forest fire danger based on annual SSR values, which have been computed using daily weather data including air temperature, relative humidity, wind and precipitation from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Other driving factors of fire regimes, such as land-use changes or fuel dynamics, are not taken into account by the SSR. The upper left map shows the average SSR values during the period 19812010; the lower left map shows the linear trends over this period, which indicate that there has been a significant increase in forest fire danger in several regions in Europe.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Climate change projections suggest substantial warming and increases in the number of droughts, heat waves and dry spells across most of the Mediterranean area and more generally in southern Europe. These projected changes would increase the length and severity of the fire season, the area at risk and the probability of large fires, possibly enhancing desertification <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>.</p> <p>Figure 2 also includes fire danger projections for projected climate conditions in 20712100 (upper right map: projected state; lower right map: projected change). The results suggest that climate change would lead to a marked increase of fire potential in south-eastern and south-western Europe; in relative terms, the increase in SSR would be particularly strong in western-central Europe <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. Similar results were obtained for other forest fire indices, such as the FWI <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>.</p> <p>The PESETAII study has estimated that the burnt area in southern Europe would more than double during the 21st century for a reference climate scenario and increase by nearly 50% for a 2C scenario <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. Another study has estimated a potential increase in burnt areas in Europe by about 200% during the 21st century under a high emissions scenario (SRES A2) assuming no adaptation.

"assessment  Forest composition and distribution     Range shifts in forest tree species due to climate change have been observed towards higher altitudes and latitudes. These changes considerably affect the forest structure and the functioning of forest ecosystems and their services.   Future climate change and increasing CO2 concentrations are expected to affect site suitability, productivity, species composition and biodiversity. In general, forest growth is projected to increase in northern Europe and to decrease in southern Europe, but with substantial regional variation. Cold-adapted coniferous tree species are projected to lose large fractions of their ranges to more drought-adapted broadleaf species.   The projected changes will have an impact on the goods and services that forests provide. For example, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50 % during the 21st century.     changes in habitat suitability plant functional type composition forest trees climate change     CLIM CLIM034 034,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Trees are slow-migrating species. Range expansion occurs primarily into newly suitable habitats at their (generally northern) latitudinal or (upper) altitudinal limit. Range contraction occurs primarily at the rear edge, which is often the most southern or the lowest lying part of their distribution range. These areas can become unsuitable for tree species as a result of direct effects (e.g. drought) or indirect effects (e.g. drought-induced pests or diseases) of climate change. In France, the altitudinal distribution of 171 forest plant species along the elevation range 02600m was studied using a 101-year data record starting in 1905. Climate warming has resulted in a significant upwards shift in species optimum elevation averaging 29m per decade, but with a wide range from +238 to 171m per decade <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Land-use changes are the most likely explanation of the observed significant downwards shifts in some regions <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. In the Montseny mountain range in north-east Spain, the altitude range of beech extended by about 70m upwards according to different data sources from the 1940s to 2001 <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. A study comparing data from the 1990s with data from the 2000s in the Spanish Pyrenees and the Iberian Peninsula found an average optimum elevation shift of 31m upwards per decade for five tree species, ranging between 34 and +181m per decade <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Nevertheless, not all studies found clear climate signals, partly because tree species can experience time lags in their migration response to climate change <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>.</p> <p>In addition to range shifts, changes in forest composition have been observed in the past. In a Swedish sprucebeech forest, a long-term study covering the period since 1894 showed that spruce has been losing its competitive advantage over beech since 1960 <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. In north-east Spain, beech forests and heather heathlands have been replaced by holm oak forest at medium altitudes (8001400m), mainly as a result of the combination of warming temperatures and land-use change <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. Field-based observations from a forest inventory providing presence and absence information from 1880 to 2010 for a Mediterranean holm oak species (Quercus ilex) have been used to investigate the migration speed in the past. In four studied forests in France along the Atlantic coast, Quercus ilex has colonised a substantial amount of new space, but the northwards movement occurred at an unexpected low maximum rate of 22 to 57m/year across the four forests <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>.</p> <p>Extreme climate and weather events such as droughts can have negative effects on food webs and regional tree dieback For the Iberian Peninsula, the defoliation of trees due to a water deficit rose significantly between 1987 and 2007 in all 16 examined tree species. Defoliation doubled on average, and this trend was paralleled by significant increases in tree mortality rates in drier areas <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. Furthermore, droughts can lead to secondary impacts on forests through pests and pathogens <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Climate change is expected to strongly affect the biological and economic viability of different tree species in Europe, as well as competition between tree species. A study in Finland showed that climate change may lead to a local reduction of forest growth but total forest growth nationwide may increase by 44% during the 21st century <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>. Observations and simulations of tree mitigation rates suggest that only fast-growing, early successional tree species will be able to track climate change <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. Recent studies that simulated forest composition and range shifts in Europe and at the global level using different climate and land-use scenarios suggest upwards shifts in the tree line and northwards migration of boreal forests <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>. Broadleaf tree cover in Europe is projected to increase during the 21st century under all climate scenarios, whereas needleleaf tree cover decreases, despite a northward extension in northern Europe (Figure 1).</p> <p>A large-scale integrated project on adaptive forest management (MOTIVE) applied an array of models (empirical as well as hybrid and process-based) in the analysis of the impacts of climate change on 38 European tree species. The results show that more drought-tolerant species such as sessile oak (Quercus petraea), pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) can be expected to become more abundant at lower altitudes throughout Europe, while other species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), lime (Tilia), elm (Ulmus) or silver fir (Abies alba) are likely to see further reductions in their ranges. Species from (sub-)Mediterranean regions such as holm oak (Quercus ilex), hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and cork oak (Quercus suber) are expected to extend their ranges to the north. Different pine species are also expected to extend their ranges quite considerably. Some species, such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), might face indirect threats from insects and other pest outbreaks, rather than direct threats from climate change alone. In summary, the projected range shifts will affect the forest structure quite considerably. Such changes will also affect the functioning of forest ecosystems and the services these ecosystems could provide <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>.</p> <p>Another modelling study assessed the impacts of projected climate change on forest composition across Europe and the economic consequences in terms of annual productivity and land value <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. It projected that the major commercial tree species in Europe, Norway spruce, will shifts northwards and to higher altitudes. It will lose large parts of its present range in central, eastern and western Europe under all scenarios (SRES A1B, A1FI and B2). Depending on the emissions scenario and climate model, between 21 and 60% (mean: 34%) of European forest lands were projected to be suitable only for a forest type of Mediterranean oak, with low economic returns by 2100, compared with 11% in the baseline period 19611990. As a result of the decline of economically valuable species, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50% (mean: 28% for an interest rate of 2%) by 2100. The economic loss in land estimation value is estimated at several hundred billion euros.</p> <p></p> <div><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> J.

For example, the value of forest land in Europe is projected to decrease between 14 and 50 % during the 21st century.","2016-12-20T16:17:06Z","2016-12-20T16:17:10Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Liechtenstein,Luxembourg,Austria,Romania,Malta,Albania,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Kosovo (UNSCR 1244/99),France,Czech Republic,Hungary,Norway,Montenegro,Netherlands,Greece,Germany,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Serbia,Lithuania,Belgium,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Biodiversity and ecosystems,Climate change adaptation","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/forest-growth-2/assessment","Indicator assessment","2069,2059,2072,2062,2052,2074,2064,2076,2054,2066,2012,2078,2056,2068,2080,2070,2060,2058,2061,2073,2051,2063,2075,2053,2065,2077,2055,2067,2057,2079,2071","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"
"assessment  Distribution shifts of plant and animal species     Observed climate change is having significant impacts on the distribution of European flora and fauna, with distribution changes of several hundred kilometres projected over the 21st century. These impacts include northwards and uphill range shifts, as well as local and regional extinctions of species.   The migration of many species is lagging behind the changes in climate owing to intrinsic limitations, habitat use and fragmentation, and other obstacles, suggesting that they are unable to keep pace with the speed of climate change. Observed and modelled differences between actual and required migration rates may lead to a progressive decline in European biodiversity.   Climate change is likely to exacerbate the problem of invasive species in Europe. As climatic conditions change, some locations may become more favourable to previously harmless alien species, which then become invasive and have negative impacts on their new environments.   Climate change is affecting the interaction of species that depend on each other for food or other reasons. It can disrupt established interactions but also generate novel ones.     bumblebee areas biodiversity climate change bumblebee butterflies birds      CLIM CLIM022 022,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>A wide variety of plant and animal species in Europe have moved northwards and uphill during recent decades. Mountain top floras across Europe have shown significant changes in species composition between 2001 and 2008, with cold-adapted species decreasing and warm-adapted species increasing in number <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. On average, most species have moved uphill. These shifts have had opposing effects on the species richness of summit floras in boreal-temperate mountain regions (+3.9 species on average) and Mediterranean mountain regions (1.4 species) <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Data from Switzerland collected over an altitudinal range of 2500m over a short period of eight years (20032010) revealed significant shifts in communities of vascular plants towards warm-dwelling species at lower altitudes. However, rates of community changes decreased with altitude <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. There is further evidence of increases in the distribution range due to climate change for several plant species <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>.</p> <p>The distributions of many terrestrial animals have recently shifted to higher elevations. In Britain, the distributions of spiders, ground beetles, butterflies, grasshoppers and allies have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11m per decade, and to higher latitudes at a rate of 17km per decade, but with substantial variability across and within taxonomic groups <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. These range shifts are partly attributable to observed changes in climatic conditions, but land-use and other environmental changes also play a role <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. A study in the Netherlands covering the period between 1932 and 2004 found that half of the investigated bird species were overwintering significantly closer to their breeding site than in the past, most likely due to warmer winters <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. A long-term trend analysis of 110 common breeding birds across Europe (19802005, 20 countries) showed that species with the lowest thermal maxima showed the sharpest declining trends in abundance <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. In other words, cold-adapted species are losing territory most quickly.</p> <p>Observations for most species show an expansion at the leading edge (i.e. by expanding the range northwards and/or uphill), whereas there is less evidence for contractions at the trailing edge (i.e. at the southern margins). However, bumblebees, which are an important pollinator for agricultural and natural ecosystems, showed a different response to the observed warming in recent decades. They suffered from strong range contractions at their southern margins of up to 300km in southern Europe during the last 40 years, but failed to expand northwards, thereby experiencing a substantial compression of their range <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. The Community Temperature Index (CTI) is a measure of the rate of change in community composition in response to temperature change. As the CTI increases, butterfly communities become increasingly composed of species associated with warmer temperatures. For example, the CTI of butterfly communities across Europe has increased by 0.14C per decade from 1970 to 2007. However, temperature has increased by 0.39C per decade in the same period, that is, almost three times faster than the butterfly community could move northwards <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. The finding that the movement of animal species is unable to keep pace with climate change has been confirmed in an analysis of the CTI of several thousand local bird and butterfly communities across Europe (see<b> </b>Figure 1) <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>.</p> <p>A comprehensive review study on amphibians and reptiles found that 20 out of the 21 amphibian and four out of the five reptilian species assessed in Europe were already affected by climate change. The reported effects were negative, mainly through population declines, reductions in habitat suitability, and reduced survival and range sizes, in more than 90% for amphibians and in more than 60% for reptiles <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. A review study on ducks (Anatidae), which are major elements of wetland biodiversity, reports shifts in winter distribution range and phenology. Nevertheless, a phenological mismatch between the periods of peak energy requirements for young and peak seasonal food availability was not found in general with regard to ducks <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p>The contribution of the Arctic to global biodiversity is substantial, as the region supports globally significant populations of birds, mammals and fish. The Arctic Species Trend Index (ASTI) has been tracking trends in 306 Arctic species. An analysis of the ASTI over 34 years (19702004) has shown that the abundance of High Arctic vertebrates declined by 26% whereas Low Arctic vertebrate species increased in abundance. Sub-Arctic species did not show a trend over the whole time period, but seem to have declined since the mid-1980s <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>.</p> <p>There is some evidence that climate change has already played a role in the spread of alien animal species in Europe.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>The observed northwards and uphill movement of many plant and animal species is projected to continue in the current century. Threatened endemic species with specific requirements of the ecotope or a small distribution range will generally be at greatest risk, in particular if they face migration barriers <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>.</p> <p>A modelling study comprising 150 high-mountain plant species across the European Alps projects average range size reductions of 4450% by the end of the 21st century <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. An assessment of the impacts of climate change on 2632 plant species across all major European mountain ranges under four future climate scenarios projected that habitat loss by 20702100 will be greater for species distributed at higher elevations <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. Depending on the climate scenario, up to 3655% of Alpine plant species, 3151% of sub-Alpine plant species and 1946% of montane plant species are projected to lose more than 80% of their suitable habitat. Nevertheless, at the finer scale, microclimate heterogeneity may enable species to persist under climate change in so called micro-climatic refugia <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>. A Europe-wide study of the stability of 856 plant species under climate change indicated that the mean stable area of species decreases significantly in Mediterranean scrubland, grassland and warm mixed forests <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>. The rate of climate change is expected to exceed the ability of many plant species to migrate, especially as landscape fragmentation may restrict movement <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. A recent study has analysed the likely shifts in distribution for 3048 plants and animals in England. Of those species, 640 (21%) were classified as being at high risk owing to the loss of substantial parts of their current distributions as a result of a 2C rise in global temperatures <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>.</p> <p>Animals generally have a greater capacity than plants to escape unfavourable climatic conditions because of their greater mobility, but they are also affected by climate change. A study based on bioclimatic envelope modelling for 120 native terrestrial European mammals under two climate scenarios showed that 1% or 59% of European mammals risk extinction <a href='#_edn22' title=''>[xxii]</a>. Another study simulated phylogenetic diversity for plants, birds and mammals in an ensemble of forecasts for 2020, 2050 and 2080 <a href='#_edn23' title=''>[xxiii]</a>. The results show that the tree of life faces a homogenisation across the continent as a result of a reduction in phylogenetic diversity in southern Europe (where immigration from northern Africa was not considered) and gains in high latitudes and altitudes. The limited dispersal ability of many reptiles, amphibians and butterflies, combined with the fragmentation of habitats, is very likely to reduce and isolate the ranges of many of those species <a href='#_edn24' title=''>[xxiv]</a>. A study on the effects of projected climate change on 181 terrestrial mammals in the Mediterranean region projected average declines in species ranges between 11 and 45%, depending on the climate scenario and assumptions regarding dispersal <a href='#_edn25' title=''>[xxv]</a>. Under a scenario of 3C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, the ranges of European breeding birds are projected to shift by about 550km to the north-east, whereby average range size would be reduced by 20%. Arctic, sub-Arctic and some Iberian species are projected to suffer the greatest range losses <a href='#_edn26' title=''>[xxvi]</a>.</p> <p>A comprehensive assessment simulated the current climatic niche and future climatically suitable conditions for almost all European bumblebee species based on over one million records from the STEP projectand three climate change scenarios for the years 2050 and 2100 (see Figure 2). The number of species on the verge of extinction by 2100 ranges from three (5% of assessed species) under the lowest climate scenario to 25 (45% of species) under the highest scenario; under the highest scenario, 53 out of 56 assessed species (95%) would lose the main part of their suitable habitat <a href='#_edn27' title=''>[xxvii]</a>. The risk of exposure to extreme climates was investigated using four global circulation model outputs and three emissions scenarios. In total, 1149 species were simulated (104 amphibians, 248 reptiles, 288 mammals and 509 breeding birds). The results showed that the main hotspots of biodiversity for terrestrial vertebrates may be significantly influenced by climate change, with a regional hotspot in the Mediterranean <a href='#_edn28' title=''>[xxviii]</a>.</p> <p>In the Arctic and sub-Arctic, warmer and wetter future conditions allow a considerable number of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds to expand their distribution range. However, various species (especially habitat specialists) are expected to contract their range over time. Furthermore, a number of new species are predicted to be able to invade the region, altering community composition and biotic interactions in ways difficult to anticipate <a href='#_edn29' title=''>[xxix]</a>.</p> <p>As the climatic conditions of some locations in Europe change, they may become more favourable to the establishment and survival of alien species, making native species, communities and ecosystems more vulnerable <a href='#_edn30' title=''>[xxx]</a>. On the other hand, climate change may also offer some opportunities to control alien species that are predicted to suffer from climate change. Whereas some components of global change, such as rising CO<sub>2</sub>, usually promote invasion, other components, such as changing temperature and precipitation, can help or hinder plant invasion. Therefore, in some cases climate change can offer unprecedented opportunities for restoration of species distribution.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> Michael Gottfried et al., Continent-Wide Response of Mountain Vegetation to Climate Change,Nature Climate Change 2, no. 2 (February 2012): 11115, doi:10.1038/nclimate1329.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref2' title=''>[ii]</a> Harald Pauli et al., Recent Plant Diversity Changes on Europes Mountain Summits,Science 336, no. 6079 (20 April 2012): 35355, doi:10.1126/science.1219033.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref3' title=''>[iii]</a> T.

"assessment  Phenology of plant and animal species     The timing of seasonal events has changed across Europe. A general trend towards earlier spring phenological stages (spring advancement) has been shown in many plant and animal species, mainly due to changes in climate conditions.   As a consequence of climate-induced changes in plant phenology, the pollen season starts on average 10 days earlier than it did and is longer than it was in the 1960s.   The life cycles of many animal groups have advanced in recent decades, with events occurring earlier in the year, including frogs spawning, birds nesting and the arrival of migrant birds and butterflies. This advancement is attributed primarily to a warming climate.   The breeding season of many thermophilic insects (such as butterflies, dragonflies and bark beetles) has been lengthening, allowing, in principle, more generations to be produced per year.   The observed trends are expected to continue into the future. However, simple extrapolations of current phenological trends may be misleading because the observed relationship between temperature and phenological events may change in the future.     species specific trends CLIM CLIM023 023,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>A variety of studies show that there has been a general trend for plant, fungi and animal species to advance their springtime phenology over the past 2050 years <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. An analysis of 315 species of fungi in England showed that, on average, they increased their fruiting season from 33 to 75 days between 1950 and 2005 <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Furthermore, climate warming and changes in the temporal allocation of nutrients to roots seem to have caused significant numbers of plant species to begin fruiting in spring as well as autumn. A study on 53 plant species in the United Kingdom found that they have advanced leafing, flowering and fruiting on average by 5.8 days between 1976 and 2005 <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Similarly, 29 perennial plant species in Spain have advanced leaf unfolding on average by 4.8 days, with first flowering having advanced by 5.9 days and fruiting by 3.2 days over the period 19432003, whereas leaf senescence was delayed on average by 1.2 days <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. For plants, a medium spring advancement of four to five days per 1C increase has been observed in Europe <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. Short warm and cold spells also can have a significant effect on phenological events, but this depends strongly on their timing and the species <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>.</p> <p>Remote sensing data can support the estimation of the trend of phenological phases over large areas. Continental-scale change patterns have been derived from time series of satellite-measured phenological variables (19822006) <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. North-eastern Europe showed a trend towards an earlier and longer growing season, particularly in the northern Baltic areas. Despite the earlier leafing, large areas of Europe exhibited a rather stable season length, indicating that the entire growing season has shifted to an earlier period. The northern Mediterranean displayed on average a shift in the growing season towards later in the year, while some instances of earlier and shorter growing seasons were also seen. The correlation of phenological time series with climate data shows a cause-and-effect relationship over the semi-natural areas. In contrast, managed ecosystems have a heterogeneous change pattern with less or no correlation with climatic trends. Over these areas, climatic trends seemed to overlap in a complex manner, with more pronounced effects of local biophysical conditions and/or land management practices. One study demonstrated that the growing season was starting earlier between 2001 and 2011 for the majority of temperate deciduous forests in western Europe, with the most likely cause being regional spring warming effects experienced during the same period <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>.</p> <p>A combination of ground observations and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) both indicated that spring phenology significantly advanced during the period 19822011 in central Europe. The average trend of 4.5 days advancement per decade was not uniform and weakened over the last decade investigated, where ground observations and NDVI observations showed different trends (see Figure 1). One possible explanation for the weakening trend from 2000 to 2010 is the response of early spring species to the cooling trend in late winter during that time frame <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. However, while individual studies find good agreement between in situ observations and experimental warming, a meta-analysis <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a> suggests that experiments can substantially under predict advances in the timing of flowering and leafing of plants in comparison with observational studies.</p> <p>The phenology of numerous animals has advanced significantly in response to recent climate change <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>. Several studies have convincingly demonstrated that the life-cycle traits of animals are strongly dependent on ambient temperatures, in both terrestrial and aquatic habitats <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. Mostly, the observed warming leads to an advanced timing of life history events. For example, temporal trends for the appearance dates of two insect species (honey bee, Apis mellifera, and small white butterfly, Pieris rapae) in more than 1000 localities in Spain have closely followed variations in recorded spring temperatures between 1952 and 2004 <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p>The predicted egg-laying date for the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) showed significant advancement between 1980 and 2004 in western and central Europe, but delays in northern Europe, both trends depending on regional temperature trends in the relevant season <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. Data from four monitoring stations in south to mid-Norway of nest boxes of the pied flycatcher from 1992 to 2011 show, contrary to the regional temperature estimated trends, that there were no significant delays in the egg-laying date for the pied flycatcher, but there was an annual fluctuation, making a rather flat curve for the median over these years <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>.</p> <p>Two studies on Swedish butterfly species showed that the average advancement of the mean flight date was 3.6 days per decade since the 1990s <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. Of the 66 investigated butterfly species, 57 showed an advancement of the mean flight date, which was significant for 45 species. A study from the United Kingdom found that each of the 44 species of butterfly investigated advanced its date of first appearance since 1976 <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. A study indicated that average rates of phenological change have recently accelerated in line with accelerated warming trends <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>. There is also increasing evidence about climate-induced changes in spring and autumn migration, including formerly migratory bird species becoming resident <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>.</p> <p>Warmer temperatures shorten the development period of European pine sawfly larvae (Neodiprion sertifer), reducing the risk of predation and potentially increasing the risk of insect outbreaks, but interactions with other factors, including day length and food quality, may complicate this prediction <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. Warmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires. The shorter, milder winters that follow might fail to kill dormant insects, increasing the risk of large, damaging infestations in subsequent seasons. For climate change factors other than temperature, the phenology of emissions of volatile compounds from flowers seems affected not only by warming or drought but also by the phenological changes in the presence of pollinators. Nevertheless, experimental evidence suggests that phenological effects on pollinatorplant synchrony may be of limited importance <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Phenology is primarily seen as an indicator to observe the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and their constituent species. However, an extrapolation of the observed relationship between temperature and phenological events into the future can provide an initial estimate of future changes in phenology. Plants and animal species unable to adjust their phenological behaviour will be negatively affected, particularly in highly seasonal habitats <a href='#_edn22' title=''>[xxii]</a>. Obviously, there are limits to possible changes in phenology, beyond which ecosystems have to adapt by changes in species composition. For six dominant European tree species, flushing is expected to advance in the next decades, but this trend substantially differed between species (from 0 to 2.4 days per decade) <a href='#_edn23' title=''>[xxiii]</a>. Interestingly, the projected advancement is quite similar to the recently observed rates and does not increase, as could have been expected from increasingly rising temperatures. This might indicate some physiological limitations in temporal adaptation to climate change. Leaf senescence of two deciduous species, which is more difficult to predict, is expected to be delayed by 1.4 to 2.3 days per decade. Earlier spring leafing and later autumn senescence are likely to affect the competitive balance between species. Species unable to adjust their phenological behaviour will be negatively affected, particularly in highly seasonal habitats. For instance, many late-succession temperate trees require a chilling period in winter, followed by a threshold in day length, and only then are sensitive to temperature. As a result, simple projections of current phenological trends may be misleading, as the relative importance of influencing factors can change <a href='#_edn24' title=''>[xxiv]</a>.</p> <p>Projections for animal phenology are mainly carried out for species of high economic interest <a href='#_edn25' title=''>[xxv]</a>. Quantitative projections are hampered by the high natural variability in phenological data, particularly in insects <a href='#_edn26' title=''>[xxvi]</a>. The projected future warming is expected to cause further shifts in animal phenology, with both positive and negative impacts on biodiversity. For example, increasing spring temperatures may have positive fitness effects in sand lizard populations in Sweden <a href='#_edn27' title=''>[xxvii]</a>. Nevertheless, climate change can lead to an increase of trophic mismatching, unforeseeable outbreaks of species, a decrease of specialist species and changes in ecosystem functioning <a href='#_edn28' title=''>[xxviii]</a>. A recent study suggests that many pollinator species are not threatened by phenological decoupling from specific flowering plants <a href='#_edn29' title=''>[xxix]</a>. Other studies simulated the consequences of the phenological shifts in plantpollinator networks and found that the breadth of the diet of pollinators might decrease because of the reduced overlap between plants and pollinators and that extinctions of plants, pollinators and their crucial interactions could be expected as consequences of these disruptions. Empirical evidence shows that climate change over the last 120 years has resulted in phenological shifts that caused interaction mismatches between flowering plants and bee pollinators. As a consequence, many bee species were extirpated from this system, potentially as a result of climate-induced phenological shifts. Although the plantpollinator interaction networks are quite flexible, redundancy has been reduced, interaction strengths have weakened and pollinator service has declined <a href='#_edn30' title=''>[xxx]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> Benjamin I.

"assessment  Water temperature     Water temperatures in major European rivers have increased by 13 C over the last century. Several time series show increasing lake and river temperatures all over Europe since the early 1900s.

The temperature of the downstream part of the Rhine increased by nearly 3C between 1910 and 2013. A similar increase of 2.4C has been observed in the Meuse. Two-thirds of the increase of the downstream part of the Rhine is attributed to the increased use of cooling water and one-third is attributed to the increase in air temperature as a result of climate change <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>.

"assessment  River floods     Almost 1 500 floods have been reported for Europe since 1980, of which more than half have occurred since 2000.   The number of very severe flood events in Europe increased over the period 19802010, but with large interannual variability. This increase has been attributed to better reporting, land-use changes and increased heavy precipitation in parts of Europe, but it is not currently possible to quantify the importance of these factors.   Global warming is projected to intensify the hydrological cycle and increase the occurrence and frequency of flood events in large parts of Europe.   Pluvial floods and flash floods, which are triggered by intense local precipitation events, are likely to become more frequent throughout Europe. In regions with projected reduced snow accumulation during winter, the risk of early spring flooding could decrease. However, quantitative projections of changes in flood frequency and magnitude remain highly uncertain.     climate change impacts floods projections river floods rcp0.5     CLIM CLIM017 017,<p><b>Past trends</b></p> <p>Figure 1 shows that the number of very severe flood events in Europe increased over the period 19802010, but with large interannual variability. The underlying data is obtained from a combination of information available in global databases such as the Dartmouth Flood Observatory(<a href='#_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a>) and the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)(<a href='#_ftn2' title=''>[2]</a>), data reported by EU Member States under the EU Floods Directive and an additional country consultation in all EEA member and cooperating countries <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Less extreme events or events with small spatial extent are not included, but the combination of data sources still leads to a large improvement over an overview based on global data sources only. Furthermore, selection of larger floods only (here with severity class very high) is expected to reduce the reporting bias <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. For comparison, the NatCatSERVICE database in total contains more than 1200 flood events that have happened since 1990, which, on average, is over 50 per year.</p> <p>Losses from flooding in Europe have increased substantially since the 1970s <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. In recent years, some flood events have been so much stronger than previous events that they have led to significant changes in flood risk estimation methods for that region, e.g. in the United Kingdom <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. The trend for increasing losses from river floods is primarily attributable to socio-economic factors, such as increasing wealth located in flood zones, but increases in heavy precipitation in parts of Europe may also play a role. Robust attribution is not yet possible because of insufficient data <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. In terms of regional GDP, flood risks are highest in large parts of eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Austria and the United Kingdom and parts of France and Italy <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. A shift from a purely technically oriented flood defense toward a more integrated flood risk management system that also considers nonstructural measures to minimize adverse effects of flooding has led to more effective flood management and to a reduction of damage caused by the 2013 floods in Germany, compared to the 2002 floods <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Future changes in the risk of river floods in Europe have been simulated using a hydrological model driven by an ensemble of climate simulations <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. Of particular interest is the frequency analysis of flood peaks above the 100-year flood level, which is the average protection level of the European river network (albeit with significant differences) <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>.</p> <p>Figure 2 shows the change in the level of one-in-a-century (Q100) floods between the reference period and three future time periods based on the hydrological model LISFLOOD and an ensemble of seven climate models <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. Blue rivers indicate an increase in flood level and red rivers indicate a decrease. For the end of the 21st century, the greatest increase in Q100 floods is projected for the British Isles, north-west and south-east France, northern Italy and some regions in south-east Spain, the Balkans and the Carpathians. Mild increases are projected for central Europe, the upper section of the Danube and its main tributaries. In contrast, decreases in Q100 floods are projected in large parts of north-eastern Europe owing to a reduction in snow accumulation, and hence melt-associated floods, under milder winter temperatures. These results are consistent with earlier studies <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>. While the ensemble mean presented in Figure 2 provides the best assessment of all model simulations together, individual simulations can show important differences from the ensemble mean for individual catchments. This is partly the result of significant decadal-scale internal variability in the simulated climate <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. Furthermore, the LISFLOOD analysis is restricted to the larger rivers in Europe, which may not be representative of a whole country or region. For example, in northern Europe, rainfall-dominated floods in smaller rivers may increase because of projected increases in precipitation amounts, even where snowmelt-dominated floods in large rivers are projected to decrease <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p>Changes in flood frequencies below the protection level are expected to have less significant economic effects and affect fewer people than even small changes in the largest events (e.g. with a return period of 500years). For a number of European river basins, including the Po, Duero, Garonne, Ebro, Loire, Rhine and Rhone, an increase in extreme floods with a return period above 500 years is projected; this includes river basins such as Guadiana and Narva, where the overall frequency of flood events is projected to decline <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. A follow-up study combined the results of this flood hazard assessment with detailed exposure maps to estimate the economic and health risks from river floods in Europe. The results suggest that a high climate change scenario could increase the socio-economic impact of floods in Europe more than three-fold by the end of the 21st century. The strongest increase in flood risk is projected for Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. A combination of different adaptation measures has been estimated to reduce economic damage from (fluvial and coastal) floods substantially by 67 to 99% and reduce the number of people flooded by 37 to 99% for the 100-year event <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ftnref1' title=''></a>([1]) <a href='http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/'>http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/</a></p> </div> <div> <p><a href='#_ftnref2' title=''></a>([2]) <a href='http://www.emdat.be'>http://www.emdat.be</a>, maintained by CRED.</p> </div> </div> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> ETC/ICM, Flood Phenomena Database  Structure and Assessment (Magdeburg: European Topic Centre on Inland, Coastal and Marine Water, 14 July 2015), http://forum.eionet.europa.eu/nrc-eionet-freshwater/library/floods/country-review-european-floods-impact-database-2015/flood-phenomena-database-structure-and-assessment.</p> </div> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref2' title=''>[ii]</a> Zbigniew W.

"assessment  River flow     Available studies suggest that run-off in near-natural rivers during the period 19632000 increased in western and northern Europe, in particular in winter, and decreased in southern and parts of eastern Europe, in particular in summer. However, comprehensive observation data on river flows are not available across Europe.   Long-term trends in river flows due to climate change are difficult to detect because of substantial interannual and decadal variability, as well as modifications to natural water flows arising from water abstractions, morphological changes (such as man-made reservoirs) and land-use changes.   Climate change is projected to result in significant changes in the seasonality of river flows across Europe. Summer flows are projected to decrease in most of Europe, including in regions where annual flows are projected to increase. Where precipitation shifts from snow to rain, spring and summer peak flow will shift to earlier in the season.     change in river flow change in streamflow climate change   CLIM CLIM016 016,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Human interventions in catchments, including water abstractions, river regulation and land-use change, have considerably altered river flow regimes in large parts of Europe, making it difficult to discern any climate-driven changes in river flow data. An inventory of river flows in Europe was produced by combining over 400 time series (from 1962 to 2004) of river catchments with near-natural flow conditions for Europe and an ensemble of eight large-scale hydrological models (for 19632000) <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. According to this inventory, run-off showed positive trends in western and northern Europe and negative trends in southern and parts of eastern Europe (Figure 1). The European pattern of annual run-off trends modelled by the ensemble mean shows a regionally coherent picture. The areas where models disagreed on the trend direction were largely located in areas of weak trends, notably in the transition areas between regions with consistent negative and positive trends. The pattern of changes in regional high flows is very similar to the pattern of changes in annual flows, whereas summer low flows have also decreased in various regions where annual flows have increased. Overall, positive trends in annual stream flow appear to reflect the marked wetting trends of the winter months, whereas negative annual trends result primarily from a widespread decrease in stream flow in spring and summer months, consistent with a decrease in summer low flow in large parts of Europe. The model uncertainties were largest in complex terrain with high spatial variability and in snow-dominated regimes.</p> <p>The magnitude of the observed seasonal changes clearly raises concerns for water resource management both today and in future decades. To date, however, despite the evidence of changes in the seasonality of flows, there is no conclusive evidence that low river flows have generally become more severe or frequent in Europe during recent decades <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Whereas many studies detect significant hydrological changes in observed datasets, more scientific rigour is needed in the attribution of river flow changes, as these studies often fall short in proving and quantifying the relationship between these changes and potential drivers <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Annual river flows are projected to decrease in southern and south-eastern Europe and increase in northern and north-eastern Europe <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Changes are projected in the seasonality of river flows, with large differences across Europe. For most parts of Europe, the peak of the average daily flow at the end of the 21st century is projected to occur earlier in the year than currently <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. In snow-dominated regions, such as the Alps, Scandinavia and parts of the Baltic, the reduction in winter retention as snow, earlier snowmelt and, in some cases, reduced summer precipitation are projected to lead to increases in river flows in winter and reductions in summer <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. Reductions of flow can be exacerbated by water abstractions, especially in summer when consumption is highest and input is typically low.

"assessment  Ocean oxygen content      Dissolved oxygen in sea water affects the metabolism of species. Therefore, reductions in oxygen content (i.e. hypoxic or anoxic areas) can lead to changes in the distribution of species, including so called dead zones.   Globally, oxygen-depleted areas have expanded very rapidly in recent decades. The number of dead zones has roughly doubled every decade since the 1960s and has increased from about 20 in the 1950s to about 400 in the 2000s.   Oxygen-depleted zones in the Baltic Sea have increased more than 10-fold, from 5 000 to 60 000 km 2 , since 1900, with most of the increase happening after 1950. The Baltic Sea now has the largest dead zone in the world. Oxygen depletion has also been observed in other European seas in recent decades.   The primary cause of oxygen depletion is nutrient input from agricultural fertilisers, causing eutrophication.

Hypoxic areas in the Baltic Sea have increased more than 10-fold, from 5000 to 60000km<sup>2</sup>, since 1900, with most of the increase happening after 1950 (Figure 2).

"assessment  Distribution shifts of marine species     Increases in regional sea temperatures have triggered a major northwards expansion of warmer water plankton and a northwards retreat of colder water plankton in the North-east Atlantic. This northerly movement has amounted to about 10  latitude (1 100 km) over the past 40 years, and it seems to have accelerated since 2000.   Sub-tropical species are occurring with increasing frequency in Europes seas, and sub-Arctic species are receding northwards.   Wild fish stocks are responding to changing temperatures and food supply by changing their distribution. This can have impacts on those local communities that depend on those fish stocks.   Further changes in the distribution of marine species, including fish stocks, are expected with the projected climate change, but quantitative projections of these distribution changes are not widely available.     climate change CLIM CLIM015 015,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Increases in regional sea temperatures have triggered a major northwards movement of species. As a result, sub-tropical species are occurring with increasing frequency in European waters, and sub-Arctic species are receding northwards. However, in areas with geographical constraints, i.e. where a coastline hinders northwards movement, some species shift into deeper and cooler waters <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Some examples are provided below.</p> <p>Plankton in the Greater North Sea have shown a northerly movement of about 10 latitude over the past 40 years. This corresponds to a mean polewards movement of around 250km per decade, which appears to have accelerated since 2000 <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. As a result, the ratio of the coldwater Calanus finmarchicus to the warmwater Calanus helgolandicus copepod species has changed considerably over time (Figure 1). While C. helgolandicus is becoming more abundant in the North Sea, the overall Calanus biomass has declined by 70% since the 1960s <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. Such rapid shifts in distribution range can reorganise marine species communities and have an impact on human communities that depend on them. For example, it has been shown that occurrences of European sprat are positively correlated with C. finmarchicus, while species such as Atlantic horse mackerel are positively correlated with C. helgolandicus <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>.</p> <p>Benthic invertebrates are also shifting their distribution range as temperatures change in the Greater North Sea, but their response lags behind the temperature increase. Unless the individual species are able to withstand a change in thermal regime, this mismatch could lead to a drop in benthic diversity <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. Such reorganisation will have an impact upon human communities and challenge traditional approaches to management of, for example fisheries, which have to consider species responses to temperature when planning future fishing opportunities <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>.</p> <p>Very fast rates of northwards movement were observed in the coastal waters of southern Norway from 1997 and 2010. About 1600 benthic marine species were found, and of these 565 species had expanded their distribution northwards along the coast, at rates of 500800km per decade <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. Phytoplankton and highly mobile pelagic species are the fastest migrating organisms; their migration rate can be an order of magnitude faster than those of terrestrial species <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>.</p> <p>Increases in the surface temperature of the North Sea in recent decades have triggered establishment of warmwater swimming crabs, which in turn has allowed establishment of colonies of lesser black-backed gulls in Belgium and northern France <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. There is also evidence that the overwintering distributions of many water birds have changed. In recent decades, in response to warming, their distributions have shifted northwards and eastwards out of the United Kingdom <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>.</p> <p>In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the introduction of warmwater and tropical alien species from the Red Sea has been exacerbated by observed warming, leading to a 150% increase in the annual mean rate of species entry after 1998 <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>.</p> <p><strong>Impacts on fisheries</strong></p> <p>Climate change is also affecting fish stocks of commercial interest. Wild fish stocks seem to be responding to changing temperatures and food supply by changing their geographical distribution and their phenology. Mackerel and horse mackerel are spawning earlier in the English Channel, and both earlier and further north on the Porcupine Bank (off the west coast of Ireland). International commercial landings from the North-east Atlantic Ocean of fish species identified as warm-adapted (e.g. grey gurnard, red mullet and hake) have increased by 250% since the 1980s, while landings of cold-adapted species (e.g. cod, haddock and whiting) have halved <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. A striking example for the potentially large economic consequences of the northwards movement of marine species is the recent establishment of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel in Greenlandic waters. This temperature-sensitive epipelagic fish was first observed in Greenlandic waters in 2011, following record-high summer temperatures. Following the rapid development of a large-scale fishery, mackerel already contributed 23% to the export value of all goods from Greenland in 2014 <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p>In the North-east Atlantic Ocean, 72% of commonly observed fish species have responded to warming waters by changing their abundance and/or distribution (Figure 2). Traditionally exploited fish species have moved further northwards in the region, while new species have moved in, most likely as a result of a shift in the thermal regime. While warming can lead to an increase in fish biodiversity in a region, there is often a concurrent decrease in the size structure of the fish population. For example, in the Greater North Sea, the relatively small species sprat, anchovy and horse mackerel have increased in recent decades, whereas the larger species cod and plaice have decreased at their southern distribution limit <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. This change may have important socio-economic consequences, as the stocks moving out tend to have a higher value than the stocks moving in. Pronounced changes in community structures and species interactions of demersal fish are projected over the next 50 years, as fish will experience constraints in the availability of suitable habitat <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>.</p> <p>Global projections of changes in total catch of marine fish and invertebrates in response to ocean warming suggest a large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an increase in high-latitude regions and a decline in the tropics. In Europe, a considerable increase in catch potential is expected in the Arctic <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>As sea surface temperatures increase, marine species will continue to seek out the most optimal temperature regime for their metabolic demands, thus leading to further northwards movement of marine species. However, quantitative projections are not widely available. Furthermore, non-indigenous species might become invasive if conditions favour their metabolic demands, while native species are weakened <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> Nicholas K.

Information on the Mediterranean for the satellite era is complemented by data from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The trends, although not necessarily the absolute SST levels, are consistent between HadISST1 and available high-resolution SST datasets for the regional seas (Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea).

"assessment  Ocean heat content     The warming of the oceans has accounted for approximately 93 % of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s. Warming of the upper (0700 m) ocean accounted for about 64 % of the total heat uptake.   A trend for increasing heat content in the upper ocean has become evident since the 1950s. Recent observations also show substantial warming of the deeper ocean (between depths of 700 and 2 000 m and below 3 000 m).   Further warming of the oceans is expected with the projected climate change. The amount of warming is strongly dependent on the emissions scenario.     global heat marine ocean   CLIM CLIM044 044,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>The warming of the oceans has accounted for approximately 93% of the warming of the Earth since the 1950s <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Ocean heat content (OHC) has increased since around 1970 (Figure 1). Differences in the values for yearly and five-yearly averages are the result of the particular method used for spatial gap filling. The linear warming trends of the uppermost 700m of the ocean and the 7002000m layer over the time period 19552013 were 0.27W/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.39W/m<sup>2</sup> (per unit area of the ocean), respectively. It is likely that the ocean warmed between 700 and 2000m from 1957 to 2014 and between 3000m and the bottom of the ocean from 1992 to 2005, while trends in ocean temperature between depths of 2000 and 3000m were not statistically significant <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the observed increase in OHC has occurred in the upper 700m of the ocean, with increases in the layers below a depth of 700m accounting for the remaining third. The strongest warming is found near the sea surface, with the upper 75m having warmed by more than 0.1C per decade since 1971. It has been estimated that heat uptake has doubled in recent decades <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. At a depth of 700m, the warming decreases to about 0.015C per decade <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. Recently, it has been determined that past increases in OHC have been substantially underestimated because of poor sampling of the Southern Hemisphere and limitations of the analysis methods <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. These concerns have not yet been considered in the datasets presented here.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>All available ocean temperature projections suggest that the global ocean will continue to warm. The largest warming is projected for the upper few hundred metres of the sub-tropical gyres, similar to the observed pattern of ocean temperature changes. Mixing and advection processes will gradually transfer the additional heat to deeper levels.</p> <p>The rate of increase of OHC is approximately proportional to the global mean change in surface air temperature. Under the low-to-medium (RCP4.5) emissions scenario, half of the energy taken up by the ocean by the end of the 21st century will be by the uppermost 700m, and 85% will be by the uppermost 2000m. Projected ocean warming varies considerably across forcing scenarios. Globally averaged projected surface warming ranges from about 1C for RCP2.6 to more than 3C for RCP8.5 during the 21st century, and at a depth of 1000m ranges from 0.5C for RCP2.6 to 1.5C for RCP8.5<a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>.</p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> J.

"assessment  Ocean acidification     Ocean surface pH has declined from 8.2 to below 8.1 over the industrial era as a result of the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This decline corresponds to an increase in oceanic acidity of about 30 %.   Ocean acidification in recent decades has been occurring 100 times faster than during past natural events over the last 55 million years.   Observed reductions in surface water pH are nearly identical across the global ocean and throughout continental European seas, except for variations near the coast. The pH reduction in the northernmost European seas, i.e. the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea, is larger than the global average.   Ocean acidification already reaches into the deep ocean, particularly at the high latitudes.   Models consistently project further ocean acidification worldwide. Ocean surface pH is projected to decrease to values between 8.05 and 7.75 by the end of 21st century, depending on future CO2 emissions levels. The largest projected decline represents more than a doubling in acidity.

Observed reductions in surface water pH are nearly identical across the global ocean and throughout continental European seas, except for variations near the coast. The pH reduction in the northernmost European seas, i.e. the Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea, is larger than the global average.   Ocean acidification already reaches into the deep ocean, particularly at the high latitudes.   Models consistently project further ocean acidification worldwide. Ocean surface pH is projected to decrease to values between 8.05 and 7.75 by the end of 21st century, depending on future CO2 emissions levels. The largest projected decline represents more than a doubling in acidity.   Ocean acidification is affecting marine organisms and this could alter marine ecosystems.","2016-12-20T15:01:15Z","2016-12-20T15:01:19Z",,"Hawaiian Ocean View (Hawaii, United States),Hawaiian Ocean View,Earth","published","Coasts and seas,Climate change adaptation","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/ocean-acidification-1/assessment","Indicator assessment","2047,2059,2007,2019,2050,2062,2074,2086,2010,2098,2022,2034,2046,2090,2036,2048,2008,2051,2063,2075,2087,2011,2099,2023,2035,2091,2069,2005,2017,2029,2072,2084,2096,2020,1998,2032,2044,2056,2068,2060,2058,2006,2018,2061,2073,2085,2097,2021,1999,2033,2045,2057,2003,2015,2027,2039,2094,2030,2042,2054,2066,2078,2002,2070,2082,2004,2016,2028,2083,2095,2031,2043,2055,2067,2100,2079,2071,2025,2037,2049,2009,2040,2052,2064,2076,2088,2000,2012,2024,2080,2092,2014,2026,2038,2041,2053,2065,2077,2001,2089,2013,2081,2093","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"
"assessment  Glaciers     The vast majority of glaciers in the European glacial regions are in retreat. Glaciers in the European Alps have lost approximately half of their volume since 1900, with clear acceleration since the 1980s.   Glacier retreat is expected to continue in the future. It has been estimated that the volume of European glaciers will decline between 22 and 84 % compared with the current situation by 2100 under a moderate greenhouse gas forcing scenario, and between 38 and 89 % under a high forcing scenario.   Glacier retreat contributed to global sea level rise by about 0.8 mm per year in 20032009. It also affects freshwater supply and run-off regimes, river navigation, irrigation and power generation. Furthermore, it may cause natural hazards and damage to infrastructure.     europe climate change cryosphere mass-balance glaciers     CLIM CLIM007 007,<p><b>Past trends</b></p> <p>A general loss of glacier mass since the beginning of the measurements has occurred in all European glacier regions, except some glaciers in Norway (Figure 1). The Alps have lost roughly 50% of their ice mass since 1900 <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. Norwegian coastal glaciers were expanding and gaining mass up to the end of the 1990s owing to increased winter snowfall on the North Atlantic Coast; now these glaciers are also retreating <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. Some ice caps at higher elevations in north-eastern Svalbard, Norway, seem to be increasing in thickness, but estimates for Svalbard as a whole show a declining mass balance <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>. The centennial retreat of European glaciers is attributed primarily to increased summer temperatures. However, changes in winter precipitation, reduced glacier albedo due to the lack of summer snowfall and various other feedback processes, such as the increasing debris cover on the glacier, can influence the behaviour of glaciers, in particular on regional and decadal scales.</p> <p>The melting of glaciers is contributing significantly to global sea level rise.

"assessment  Snow cover     Snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere has declined significantly over the past 90 years, with most of the reductions occurring since 1980. Over the period 19672015, snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased by 7 % on average in March and April and by 47 % in June; the observed reductions in Europe are even larger, at 13 % for March and April and 76 % for June.   Snow mass in the Northern Hemisphere is estimated to have decreased by 7 % in March from 1982 to 2009; snow mass in Europe has decreased more rapidly than the average for the Northern Hemisphere, but with large interannual variation.   Model simulations project widespread reductions in the extent and duration of snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and in Europe over the 21st century.   Changes in snow cover affect the Earths surface reflectivity, water resources, flora and fauna and their ecology, agriculture, forestry, tourism, snow sports, transport and power generation.     climate change cryosphere snow mass snow cover snow cover extent     CLIM CLIM008 008,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>Satellite observations of monthly snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere are available from 1967 onwards <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. A detailed analysis based on multiple sources shows there have been significant decreases in Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent during the spring melt season since about 1980 (March to June; Figure 1, left) <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>; in other seasons, the snow cover extent has remained stable or even slightly increased. A separate analysis for Europe (EEA-39 region) shows even larger reductions of 13% for March and April, and 76% for June between 1980 and 2015 (Figure 1, right).</p> <p>Decreases in snow cover extent are caused by an earlier onset of melting and a shorter duration of the snow season. Since 1972, the duration of the snow season averaged over the Northern Hemisphere declined by fivedays per decade, but with substantial regional variation. The duration of the snow season has decreased by up to 25days in western, northern and eastern Europe due to earlier spring melt, whereas it has increased by up to 15days in south-eastern Europe due to an earlier onset of the snow season <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>.</p> <p>The snow mass (i.e. the amount of water that the snow contains) is an important variable, as it affects the role of snow in the hydrological cycle. For the whole of the Northern Hemisphere, a 7% decrease in March snow mass was observed between 1982 and 2009 <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. An extension of this data focusing on EEA member countries demonstrates a stronger average decline of 30% for the period 19802015, although the year-to-year variation is large (Figure 2). Winter increases in precipitation have also led to an increase in snow mass at higher altitudes in Norway.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Northern Hemisphere snow cover will continue to shrink and snow seasons shorten as temperatures rise <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>, although in the coldest regions snowfall can also increase in the middle of winter <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. The multi-model mean from the CMIP5 modelling exercise projects changes in March/April snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere during the 21st century ranging from 7% for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) to 25% for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) (Figure 3). The projected snow mass generally follows the snow cover extent with an estimated range of reduction from about 10% for RCP2.6 to about 30% for RCP8.5; projected reductions in the duration of the snow season range from about 10days for RCP2.6 to about 40days for RCP8.5 <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>.</p> <p>Specific regional studies suggest significant reductions in snow mass in, for example, the Alps in general <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>, Switzerland <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>, the alpine range of Italy <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>, the Pyrenees <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>, Norway <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>, the Turkish mountains <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a> and the Balkan mountains <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. These changes can have dramatic downstream effects as melt water contributes up to 6070% to annual river flows.

Changes in snow cover affect the Earths surface reflectivity, water resources, flora and fauna and their ecology, agriculture, forestry, tourism, snow sports, transport and power generation.","2016-12-20T14:42:19Z","2016-12-20T14:42:24Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Liechtenstein,Cyprus,Austria,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Czech Republic,Norway,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Lithuania,Belgium,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Finland,Italy","Earth,Europa","published","Climate change adaptation","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/snow-cover-3/assessment","Indicator assessment","2047,2059,2007,1991,2019,2050,1940,2062,2074,1992,2086,1976,2098,2010,2022,1988,1952,2034,2046,1964,1936,1948,1924,2090,2036,2048,1980,2008,2051,2063,1981,1993,2075,1965,2087,2011,1977,2099,1941,2023,2035,1953,1925,1937,1989,2091,1949,2069,2005,2017,2029,2072,1950,1962,2084,2096,2020,2032,1998,1922,2044,2056,1974,1986,2068,1958,1934,1946,2060,2058,2006,2018,1990,2061,1951,2073,2085,2097,1987,2021,2033,1999,1963,2045,2057,1975,1947,1959,1923,1935,2003,2015,2027,2039,1972,2094,1984,2030,2042,1960,1932,2054,2066,1944,1996,2078,2002,1956,1968,2070,2082,1928,2004,2016,2028,2083,1961,1973,2095,2031,2043,1933,2055,2067,2100,1985,1997,2079,1969,1945,1957,1929,2071,2025,2037,2049,2009,1994,2040,2052,1970,1982,2064,1954,2076,2000,1966,2088,2012,1930,2024,1942,1926,1978,2080,1938,2092,2014,2026,2038,1983,1995,2041,2053,1971,1943,2065,2077,1955,2001,2089,1931,2013,1967,1979,2081,1927,2093,1939","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"
"assessment  Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets     The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest bodies of ice in the world and play an important role in the global climate system. Both ice sheets have been losing large amounts of ice at an increasing rate since 1992.   The cumulative ice loss from Greenland from 1992 to 2015 was 3 600 Gt and contributed to global sea level rise by approximately 10 mm; the corresponding figure for Antarctica is 1 500 Gt, which corresponds to approximately a 5 mm global sea level rise since 1992.   Model projections suggest further declines of the polar ice sheets in the future, but the uncertainties are large. The melting of the polar ice sheets is estimated to contribute up to 50 cm of global sea level rise during the 21st century. Very long-term projections (until the year 3000) suggest potential sea level rise of several metres with continued melting of the ice sheets.     sea level rise greenland ice sheet cryosphere antarctic ice sheet climate change     CLIM CLIM009 009,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>The mass balance of the polar ice sheets is affected by numerous factors, including changes in precipitation patterns over the ice sheets, snowfall, changes in the snowline, summer melting of snow, changes in ice sheet albedo, changes in the extent of supraglacial lakes, submarine melting of the floating ice shelves at the tongue of marine outlet glaciers, and icebergs breaking off of glaciers <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. The changing balance between ice accumulation, on the one hand, and melting and sublimation of ice and snow, submarine melting and calving, on the other hand, determines the future development of the ice sheets. Both ice sheets have lost significant amounts of ice since 2005 (Figure 1).</p> <p>Several different methods have been used to monitor the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet. The overall conclusion of all available studies is that Greenland is losing mass (Figure 1). Average ice loss increased from 34 (uncertainty interval: 6 to 74) billion tonnes per year over the period 19922001 to 215 (157 to 274) billion tonnes per year over the period 20022011. In 2012, an exceptional loss estimated at more than 500 billion tonnes was recorded. From 1992 to 2012, the contribution to the global sea level has been estimated to have been approximately 8.0mm (6.6 to 9.4mm) <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. In 20132015, the net loss of ice was slower than in 2012, with a total of approximately 280 billion tonnes net loss over the period <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>.</p> <p>In Greenland, the area subject to summer melt has increased significantly over recent decades <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. The increased melting has been attributed to changes in general circulation in summer, creating warmer conditions over Greenland <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. Ice core data suggest that large-scale melting events such as the one observed in 2012 have occurred once every few hundred years on average, with previous ones in 1889 and in the 12th century. It is not currently possible to tell whether the frequency of these rare extensive melt events has changed <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>. Another important process that may accelerate the loss of ice from the ice sheets is enhanced submarine melting of glaciers terminating in the sea. Its importance may be greater than previously assumed. The process has been documented for both the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>.</p> <p>East Antarctica had a slightly positive mass balance of +14 (29 to +57) billion tonnes per year over the period 19922011, but, overall, the Antarctic ice sheet has lost on average approximately 70 billion tonnes of ice per year, as West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula have lost 65 (39 to 91) and 20 (6 to 34) billion tonnes per year, respectively. The floating ice shelves have also become thinner <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. From 1992 to 2015, the ice loss of the Antarctic ice sheet has contributed approximately 5mm (2 to 7mm) to the global sea level <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>. All in all, the ice sheets have contributed to about one-third of the total sea level rise since the 1990s <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. A recent study of Antarctica suggests, however, that the snow accumulation has exceeded the mass loss from ice discharge, leading to the equivalent of an annual 0.23mm sea level depletion between 2003 and 2008 <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>All recent studies indicate that the mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet will increase the global sea level, with greater radiative forcing leading to greater sea level rise. Recent studies suggest an upper bound of 16cm of sea level rise from the Greenland ice sheet during the 21st century for a high emissions scenario and somewhat lower values for lower emissions scenarios <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>. One recent study estimated that the Greenland ice sheet contribution until the year 3000 will be 1.4, 2.6 and 4.2m for the emissions scenarios SRES B1, A1B and A2 (with stabilised greenhouse concentrations after 2100), respectively <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>.</p> <p>On multi-millennial time scales, the Greenland ice sheet shows threshold behaviour due to different feedback mechanisms. If a temperature above the threshold is maintained for an extended period, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet could self-amplify, which would eventually result in near-complete ice loss (equivalent to a sea level rise of about 7m). Coupled climateice sheet models with a fixed topography (that do not consider the feedback between surface mass balance and the height of the ice sheet) estimate that the global mean surface air temperature threshold above which the Greenland ice will completely melt lies between 2 and 4C above pre-industrial levels <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>. In contrast, a study modelling the ice sheet dynamically suggests that the threshold could be as low as about 1C above pre-industrial levels <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. The complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet is not inevitable because it has a long time scale. Complete melting would take tens of millennia if near the threshold and a millennium or more for temperatures a few degrees above the threshold <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>.</p> <p>The uncertainties around future ice discharge from Antarctica, and the associated sea level rise, are larger than for Greenland. However, mass loss of the Antarctic ice sheet has a greater impact on the sea level in the Northern Hemisphere than a comparable loss of the Greenland ice sheet, owing to gravitational forces. A comprehensive analysis applying various climate, ocean and ice sheet models estimates that the additional ice loss for the 21st century is 7cm (90% range: 023cm) of global sea level equivalent for a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) and 9cm (90% range: 137cm) for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>. By 2100, the rise of global sea level will be clearly influenced by the development of the Antarctic ice sheet. A recent study suggests that the Antarctic ice sheet has the potential to contribute more than a metre to sea level rise by 2100 and more than 15metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>.</p> <p>Several studies that were published after the release of the IPCCAR5 suggest that melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has been accelerating recently and that a WAIS collapse is already inevitable and irreversible. There are also indications of instability in some parts of the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet. These new results suggest that the global mean sea level contribution from Antarctica alone could be several metres on a time scale of a few centuries to a millennium <a href='#_edn19' title=''>[xix]</a>.</p> <p>The long-term development of the ice sheets is hugely important in determining the consequences of climate change. Amplifying feedback mechanisms, including slowdown of meridional overturning circulation, may accelerate ice sheet mass loss <a href='#_edn20' title=''>[xx]</a>. A coupled ice sheetice shelf model suggests that, if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2C above present, the major Antarctic ice shelves would collapse, which would trigger a centennial- to millennial-scale response of the Antarctic ice sheet and cause an unstoppable contribution to sea level rise <a href='#_edn21' title=''>[xxi]</a>. Although current estimates of sea level rise by 2100 suggest that they will fall in a range of some tens of centimetres <a href='#_edn22' title=''>[xxii]</a>, collapsing ice sheets could, in the long term, result in a faster and greater rise in sea level than currently assumed, underlining the urgency of climate change mitigation <a href='#_edn23' title=''>[xxiii]</a>. The uncertainties in the long-term projections are significant, however. Assumptions concerning, for example, bedrock uplift and sea surface drop associated with ice sheet retreat have a significant effect on the results with respect to sea level rise <a href='#_edn24' title=''>[xxiv]</a>.<b></b></p> <div><br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> J.

Over the period 19792015, the Arctic has lost, on average, 42 000 km 2  of sea ice per year in winter and 89 000 km 2  per year by the end of summer.   The nine lowest Arctic sea ice minima since records began in 1979 have been the September ice cover in each of the last nine years (20072015); the record low Arctic sea ice cover in September 2012 was roughly half the average minimum extent of 19812010. The annual maximum ice cover in March 2015 and March 2016 were the lowest on record, and the ice is also getting thinner.   The maximum sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea shows a decreasing trend since about 1800. The decrease appears to have accelerated since the 1980s, but the interannual variability is large.   Arctic sea ice is projected to continue to shrink and thin. For high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September is likely before mid-century. There will still be substantial ice in winter.   Baltic Sea ice, in particular the extent of the maximal cover, is projected to continue to shrink.     cryosphere climate change arctic sea ice ocean baltic sea sea ice extent northern hemisphere arctic sea ice         CLIM CLIM010 010,<p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Past trends</strong></p> <p>In the period 19792015, the sea ice extent in the Arctic decreased by 42000km<sup>2</sup> per year in winter (measured in March) and by 89000km<sup>2</sup> per year in summer (measured in September) (Figure 1), which, based on historical records, is likely unprecedented since the 14th century <a href='#_edn1' title=''>[i]</a>. The maximum sea ice extent in March 2015 and March 2016 were the lowest on record. Arctic sea ice loss is driven by a combination of warmer ocean waters and a warmer atmosphere, including an earlier onset of summer surface melt <a href='#_edn2' title=''>[ii]</a>. In contrast, Antarctic sea ice has reached record high levels in recent years, but the expansion of the Antarctic sea ice has been less than half of the loss of Arctic sea ice <a href='#_edn3' title=''>[iii]</a>.</p> <p>Changes in Arctic sea ice may trigger complex feedback processes. Warming and a longer melt season result in increased solar heat uptake by the ocean, which delays the autumn refreeze <a href='#_edn4' title=''>[iv]</a>. However, a warmer atmosphere means that there are more clouds and, in summer, these reflect sunlight, thus representing a negative feedback mechanism. Even so, some evidence suggests that winter regrowth of ice is inhibited by the warmer ocean surface <a href='#_edn5' title=''>[v]</a>. Thinner winter ice leads to more heat loss from the ocean and a warmer atmosphere, and hence thicker cloud cover, which inhibits the escape of heat to space <a href='#_edn6' title=''>[vi]</a>, which is a positive feedback mechanism.</p> <p>The minimum Arctic sea ice cover at the end of the melt season in September 2012 broke all previously observed records. All years since 2002 have been below the average for 19812010 (Figure 1). Comparison of recent sea ice coverage with older ship and aircraft observations suggests that summer sea ice coverage may have halved since the 1950s <a href='#_edn7' title=''>[vii]</a>. Since more reliable satellite observations started in 1979, summer ice has shrunk by 10% per decade <a href='#_edn8' title=''>[viii]</a>. Between 1979 and 2011, the reduction of sea ice has significantly reduced albedo, corresponding to an additional 6.40.9W/m<sup>2</sup> of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25% of that due to the change in CO<sub>2</sub> during this period <a href='#_edn9' title=''>[ix]</a>.</p> <p>The Arctic sea ice is also getting thinner and younger, as less sea ice survives the summer to grow into thicker multi-year floes <a href='#_edn10' title=''>[x]</a>. A recent analysis has found that annual mean ice thickness has decreased from 3.59m in 1975 to 1.25m in 2012, i.e. a 65% reduction in less than 40 years <a href='#_edn11' title=''>[xi]</a>. This supports findings from calculations of sea ice volume from satellites and an earlier estimate by the Pan Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS)(<a href='#_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a>), which suggests that the mean monthly sea ice volume has decreased by about 3000km<sup>3</sup>/decade since 1979 <a href='#_edn12' title=''>[xii]</a>.</p> <p>Information on sea ice extent in the Baltic Sea goes back to 1720. The maximum sea ice extent has displayed a decreasing trend most of the time since about 1800 (Figure 2). The decrease in sea ice extent appears to have accelerated since the 1980s, but large interannual variability makes it difficult to demonstrate this statistically <a href='#_edn13' title=''>[xiii]</a>. The frequency of mild ice winters, defined as having a maximum ice cover of less than 130000km<sup>2</sup>, has, however, increased from seven in 30 years in the period 19501979 to 15 in the period 19862015. The frequency of severe ice winters, defined as having a maximum ice cover of at least 270000km<sup>2</sup>, has decreased from six to four during the same periods.</p> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Projections</strong></p> <p>Improving the ability to track the observed rapid summer-time melting of Arctic sea ice has been a challenge for modelling <a href='#_edn14' title=''>[xiv]</a>, but observations fall well within the model range in recent modelling studies <a href='#_edn15' title=''>[xv]</a>. All model projections agree that Arctic sea ice will continue to shrink and thin. For high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in September is likely to occur before mid-century (Figure 3) <a href='#_edn16' title=''>[xvi]</a>. An extension beyond 2100 suggests that, for the highest emissions scenario (RCP8.5), the Arctic could become ice-free year-round before the end of the 22nd century; on the other hand, a recovery of Arctic sea ice could become apparent in the 22nd century if stringent policies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, and eventually concentrations, are successfully implemented <a href='#_edn17' title=''>[xvii]</a>.</p> <p>Projections of Baltic Sea ice extent under different emissions scenarios suggest that the maximal ice cover and ice thickness will continue to shrink significantly over the 21st century. The best estimate of the decrease in maximum ice extent from a model ensemble is 6400km<sup>2</sup>/decade for a medium emissions scenario (RCP4.5) and 10900km<sup>2</sup>/decade for a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5); for the latter scenario, largely ice-free conditions are projected by the end of the century <a href='#_edn18' title=''>[xviii]</a>.</p> <div> <p class='Subsubsection'><strong>Further information</strong></p> <p>An animation from NOAA shows the decline in multi-year Arctic sea ice extent from 1987 to 2014: <a href='https://youtu.be/FDRnH48LvhQ'>https://youtu.be/FDRnH48LvhQ</a></p> <br clear='all' /><hr align='left' size='1' width='33%' /> <div> <p>([1]) <a href='http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/'>http://psc.apl.uw.edu/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/</a></p> </div> </div> <div><br /> <div> <p><a href='#_ednref1' title=''>[i]</a> J.

One cause of these increased emissions is the introduction of policy measures that have encouraged the burning of renewable materials (e.g. wood by Danish households). Wood burning produces emissions of PAHs and hence, in this instance, policies that have been implemented to address one environmental issue (climate change) have had unintended consequences on another (air pollution). In absolute terms, the emissions of PAHs from these countries are relatively low compared with other countries, but the effect on local populations and environmental quality may, nevertheless, be notable.

"co2-emissions-from-cars-and  CO2 emissions from cars and vans: all larger manufacturers met their 2015 targets  Based on current testing rules in force, virtually all car and van manufacturers have met their specific CO2 emissions target in 2015, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). The report confirms preliminary findings published earlier this year showing that the EU as a whole is well below its average emissions target for the same year.    The new EEA report, ' Monitoring CO 2  emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2015 ', provides a summary of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission levels of new passenger cars and vans in the European Union (EU) in 2015 based on laboratory tests following a standard European vehicle test protocol used for vehicle type-approval.   The new findings largely confirm preliminary data published for  cars  and  vans  earlier this year. They show that new cars sold in the EU in 2015 had CO 2  average emissions of 119.5 g CO 2 /km, which was 8.0 % below the 2015 target of 130 g CO 2 /km, and 27 % lower than in 2004.  Similarly, the average emissions from vans sold in 2015 were 168.3 g CO 2 /km, below the 2017 target of 175 g CO 2 /km. This represents a reduction of 6.5 % since monitoring commenced in 2012. In order to meet their respective future targets, i.e. 147 g CO 2 /km for vans by 2020 and 95 g CO 2 /km for cars by 2021, the average CO 2  emissions need to continue decreasing at a similar pace.   The report also presents data on manufacturer’s individual performances. The majority of car and van makers met their CO 2  specific emissions target in 2015. Two manufacturers, Aston Martin Lagonda and Ferrari, exceeded their specific emissions target by a small amount and therefore excess emission premiums will be imposed.   Other key findings     As in previous years, conventional diesel and petrol cars accounted for the large majority of new sales in 2015 (97.2 %). Diesel vehicles remained the most sold vehicles in Europe, constituting 52 % of sales, slightly lower than in 2014 when 53 % of all new cars were fuelled by diesel. The proportion of plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles increased from 0.8 % in 2014 to more than 1 % in 2015. For vans, the vast majority of vehicles are fuelled with diesel (97 %).   Diesel cars, which on average are 300 kg heavier than petrol cars, emitted on average 119.2 g CO 2 /km. This is 3.3 g CO 2 /km less than the average for petrol cars. The emission difference between diesel and petrol cars has been narrowing in the last decade. In 2000 the difference was 17.1 g CO 2 /km.   Amongst the largest car manufacturers, Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen, Renault and Toyota Motor Europe continue to produce most of the lowest-emitting cars. Improving their performance by more than 5 g CO 2 /km, Automobiles Peugeot (104 g CO 2 /km) and Automobiles Citroen (106 g CO 2 /km) had the lowest average CO 2  emissions for new passenger cars registered in 2015.   Toyota Motor Europe had the highest percentage of new vehicles having emissions below 95 g CO 2 /km (41 %).   The largest reductions in average emission levels in the last year were achieved by Jaguar Land Rover Limited (14.4 g CO 2 /km) and Daimler AG (6.9 g CO 2 /km).   For the third year in a row, Automobile Dacia SA achieved the lowest average CO 2  emissions from vans (133 g CO 2 /km). Automobiles Peugeot, Automobiles Citroen and Renault also produce low emitting vans (less than 151 g CO 2 /km).         Latest data sets CO 2  emissions from cars and vans:      Data for cars     Data for vans          CO 2  emissions by car manufacturer        Background   EEA activities    In accordance with current  EU regulations ((EC) No 443/2009 for passenger cars and (EU) No 510/2011 for vans) , the EEA collects  data on all new vehicles registered in Europe  and makes it available online. The data collected includes information on various parameters, including CO 2  emissions and vehicle mass. Data is reported by all Member States in order to evaluate the performance of the new vehicle fleet towards the respective CO 2  emissions targets.   The EEA report documents the latest official data submitted by Member States and vehicle manufacturers. However, it is not possible to assess the extent to which incorrect data from vehicle manufacturers may alter the analysis and conclusions. The final CO 2  performance for each manufacturer and pool is confirmed by Commission Decision.     Laboratory versus real world driving emissions    Member States report new vehicles’ CO 2  emission levels, measured under  standardised laboratory conditions, following the requirements of the  New European Driving Cycle  (NEDC) test procedur e. This cycle allows a comparison of emissions by manufacturers, but it does not necessarily represent real-world driving conditions. There is now wide recognition of the increasing divergence between real world CO 2  emissions and those measured according to the NEDC test procedure.  In order to address this increasing gap, the European Commission has proposed in June 2016 the implementation of a more robust test procedure, the World Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). This new test procedure will ensure more strict and representative test conditions. It is foreseen that the new WLTP test will be mandatory for all new vehicle types from September 2017 and for all new vehicles from September 2018.    Additional information   The  European Commission press release :  CO 2  emissions from new cars and vans continue to fall    emissions from transport road transport van emissions eu emission standards for road vehicles car emissions,<p>The new EEA report, '<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/monitoring-co-2-emissions-from' class='internal-link' target='_self'>Monitoring CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from passenger cars and vans in 2015</a>', provides a summary of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission levels of new passenger cars and vans in the European Union (EU) in 2015 based on laboratory tests following a standard European vehicle test protocol used for vehicle type-approval.</p> <p>The new findings largely confirm preliminary data published for <a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/reported-co2-emissions-from-new'>cars</a> and <a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/reduction-of-co2-emissions-from'>vans</a> earlier this year.

"european-hazardous-waste-management-improving  European hazardous waste management improving, but its prevention needs attention  Despite improvements in hazardous waste management, more measures would be required to prevent the build-up of hazardous waste across Europe, according to a European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today. The report reviews the application of waste prevention programmes across European countries regarding waste types that are considered to be most dangerous to human health and the environment.    The EEA report ‘ Prevention of hazardous waste in Europe – the status in 2015 ,’  is the third annual review of waste prevention programmes done by the EEA. This year’s review focuses on the prevention of hazardous waste that is one of the priorities of environmental policies in Europe. The assessment looks at current trends in the amounts of hazardous waste generated both in Europe and in individual countries, based on the latest data available. It provides an overview of waste prevention objectives, targets, indicators, and measures.   At a reported 100 million tonnes, hazardous waste accounted for close to 4% of the 2.5 billion tonnes of waste generated across the European Union in 2012. The predominant types of hazardous waste were mineral and solidified wastes, chemical and medical wastes, with the waste management, construction, mining and quarrying, and household sectors as the top sources. Total hazardous waste generation has increased slightly since 2008, according to the report.   More than half of the reviewed waste prevention programmes include measures to reduce the generation of hazardous waste. Most of the measures are linked to curbing production and including bans on toxic materials. However, prevention of hazardous waste appears to have lower priority than management aspects, and limited financial support. Prioritisation at the EU level is one of the drivers for better prevention at national or regional levels, the report says.   The report also raises data quality issues, and highlights that changes in waste classification and definition of hazardous waste cause reporting and interpretation problems and may affect the accuracy and comparability of national data. This is also likely to affect national target setting and indicator development.     More information about waste prevention programmes is available in  individual country/region fact sheets.     waste generation waste prevention electronic waste eu waste types hazardous waste waste management targets,<p>The EEA report ‘<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/waste-prevention-in-europe' class='external-link' target='_self'>Prevention of hazardous waste in Europe – the status in 2015</a>,’  is the third annual review of waste prevention programmes done by the EEA.

The predominant types of hazardous waste were mineral and solidified wastes, chemical and medical wastes, with the waste management, construction, mining and quarrying, and household sectors as the top sources. Total hazardous waste generation has increased slightly since 2008, according to the report.</p> <p>More than half of the reviewed waste prevention programmes include measures to reduce the generation of hazardous waste. Most of the measures are linked to curbing production and including bans on toxic materials. However, prevention of hazardous waste appears to have lower priority than management aspects, and limited financial support. Prioritisation at the EU level is one of the drivers for better prevention at national or regional levels, the report says.</p> <p>The report also raises data quality issues, and highlights that changes in waste classification and definition of hazardous waste cause reporting and interpretation problems and may affect the accuracy and comparability of national data.

"assessment  Overview of electricity production and use in Europe   In 2014, low-carbon energy sources (renewables and nuclear energy) continued to dominate the electricity mix for the second year in a row,   together   generating more power than fossil fuel sources.      In 2014, fossil fuels were responsible for 42 % of all gross electricity generation, a decrease of 25 % compared with 1990 across  the EU-28  .    By way of contrast, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources is growing rapidly and reached more than one quarter of all gross electricity generation in the EU-28 (29 %  in 2014  ), more than twice as much as in 1990. As such, renewable sources generated more electricity in 2014 than nuclear sources or coal and lignite.    Nuclear energy sources contributed roughly one quarter of all gross electricity generation in 2014 (27.5 %).         Final electricity consumption (the total consumption of electricity by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) has increased by 25 % in the EU-28 since 1990, at an average rate of around 0.9 % per year (see ENER 016). In the EU-28, the strongest growth was observed in the services sector (2.5 % per year), followed by households (1.1 % per year).       With regard to the non-EU EEA countries, between 1990 and 2014 electricity generation increased by an average of 6.5 % per year in Turkey, 6.3 % per year in Iceland and 0.5 % per year in Norway.    energy consumption electric sector electricity energy electricity consumption ghg retrospective      ENER ENER038 038,<p>Power generation is becoming more efficient in the EU-28, with the average efficiency having increased from 36 % in 1990 to 44 % in 2014.

The growth of electricity consumption in non-EU EEA countries was dominated by the increased electricity consumption in Turkey. Here, the high consumption rate is due to Turkey's rapid transition to a modernised economy, with the associated increase in electricity generation and use. Between 2005 and 2014, there was a continued increase of 8.9 % per year for Iceland and 5.3 % per year for Turkey, while in Norway electricity consumption decreased by 0.2 % per year.</p> <p><strong>Electricity consumption by sector</strong></p> <p>The increase in electricity consumption since 1990 can be traced back to an increase in consumption in the services (83 %) and households (29 %) sectors (see Figure 3). Since 2005, electricity consumption in the services sector continued to increase (by 10 %), while electricity consumption in the household sector decreased by 2 %. Electricity consumption in industry also decreased (by 12 %) over the same period due to improvements in industrial processes and a slightly decrease in activity.</p> <p>In 2014:</p> <ul> <li>Industry remained the largest electricity-consuming sector in the EU-28, accounting for 37 % of all electricity consumption (compared with 46 % in 1990).

Between 2005 and 2014, electricity consumption in the household sector actually decreased by 0.2 %. Improvements in the energy efficiency of large electrical appliances such as refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dishwashers, TVs and dryers were offset by the use, number and size of large appliances as well as by a growing number of smaller appliances, including new IT appliances (explanatory factors for the energy consumption of households are shown in ENER 037)<span>.</span></li> </ul> <li>The transport sector <span>was responsible for only 2.3 % of all electricity consumption in the EU-28 in 2014 (2.9 % in 1990).

After 2002, it decreased to slightly below the 1990 level (5.3 Mtoe in 2014). The increased consumption of electricity for transport purposes (railways) in some countries, such as France and Italy, counterbalanced a decrease in electricity consumed for railways in some new Member States, such as Poland and the Czech Republic.</span></li> <li>Agriculture, forestry and fishing were responsible for a mere 2 % of all electricity consumption in the EU-28 (2.6 % in 1990).

The EU-wide consumption average varies greatly between countries, with a low per-capita consumption observed in some new Member States in 2014, including Romania (2 101 kWh/capita), Lithuania (3 138 kWh/capita), Latvia (3 289 kWh/capita), Poland (3 311 kWh/capita), Croatia (3493 kWh/capita) and Hungary (3 513 kWh/capita), and a high per-capita consumption observed in other Member States, including Finland (14 517 kWh/capita) and Sweden (12 669 kWh/capita). In Sweden, this is due to the high market penetration of electrical heating linked to the low-cost of hydropower produced electricity (see Figure 5 and ENER 037). The increasing use of air conditioning in southern European countries also contributes to a large increase in electricity consumption during the summer months.</p> <p>Between 1990 and 2014, electricity consumption per capita in non-EU EEA countries decreased at an average annual rate of 0.3 % in Norway, while it grew rapidly in Iceland and Turkey at an average annual rate of 5.2 % and 5.1 %, respectively. In 2014, per capita electricity consumption reached 21 224 kWh for Norway and 51724 kWh for Iceland, whereas for Turkey it was one order of magnitude smaller (2 680 kWh).</p>,<p><strong>Electricity generation</strong></p> <p>Between 1990 and 2014, gross electricity generation<a href='#_ftn1' title=''>[1]</a>in the EU-28 increased by 23 % at an average rate of 0.9 % per year.

A closer look at the trend reveals an increase between 1990 and 2005 of 1.5 % per year and, after 2005, an average decrease of 1.4 % per year. Nuclear electricity totally disappeared in Lithuania as a result of decommissioning the last nuclear reactor in 2009, but there are plans for a new nuclear power plant. Furthermore, nuclear electricity decreased between 2005 and 2014 in Germany (-5.6 % per year), Belgium (-3.8 %) and the United Kingdom (-2.7 %), while it increased in countries such as Romania (8.6 % per year), the Czech Republic (2.3 % per year) and Hungary (1.4 % per year).</p> <p>In the wake of the Fukushima accident of 2011, several countries plan to step up the decommissioning of nuclear power plants (e.g. Belgium, Germany, Spain and Switzerland, with Germany planning to decommission all of its nuclear plants by 2022 and Spain banning the construction of new reactors). Other countries, however, are still considering to increase their nuclear capacity (Romania, United Kingdom), have new nuclear power plants under construction (e.g. Bulgaria, Finland, France and Slovakia) or have paved the way to extend the lifetime of existing nuclear reactors (Sweden). However, the costs of nuclear electricity generation have increased since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 (e.g. by about 20 % in France between 2010 and 2013, because of investments in maintenance and safety measures).</p> <p><strong>Renewable electricity generation</strong><b></b></p> <p>The electricity produced from renewable sources increased by 184 % between 1990 and 2014 at an average annual rate of 4.5 %. After 2005, the rate increased to 7.3 % per year. The acceleration observed since 2005 occurred in the context of national and EU renewable energy support policies and significant cost reductions achieved by certain renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaics in recent years. In 2014, 44 % of renewable electricity was generated from hydro (94 % in 1990), 27 % from wind (0 % in 1990), 18 % from biomass (4 % in 1990), 11 % from solar (0 % in 1990) and 1 % from geothermal (1 % in 1990).</p> <p><strong>Carbon intensity of EU-28 electricity production</strong></p> <p>In the light of the increased role of renewable electricity and the fuel shifts observed between 1990 and 2014, the carbon intensity of the<span>total electricity generation in the EU-28 is over one third (36 %) lower today than in 1990 (decreasing from</span><span>431 gCO</span><sub>2</sub><span>/kWh in 1990 to <span>276 g</span><span><span>CO</span><sub>2</sub><span></span>/kWh in 2014</span>) (Figure 1b).

"climate-finance-resources-for-low  Climate finance: resources for low-carbon, climate-resilient Europe  Our climate is changing. We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit the rate of climate change, and at the same time, take measures that help us prepare for current and future impacts. Both of these strands of action require unprecedented redirection of investments. This was acknowledged by the climate conferences in Paris and recently in Marrakesh. The finance sector can and will play an instrumental role in supporting Europe’s transition towards a low- carbon, climate-resilient society.   Europe needs to invest substantially in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Estimates of the actual amounts needed vary significantly and, depending on the scope, scale or methodology, can amount up to hundreds of billions of Euros per year. Compared to the overall financing capacity of the finance system, these investments needs are relatively small. Yet, despite its extensive capacity, the finance system currently meets only a fraction of the investment need.   The main challenges for boosting climate-friendly investments include, among others, overcoming existing barriers and lock-ins in the finance system which prolong and promote unsustainable activities; and redirecting funds towards initiatives that boost climate resilience and reduce carbon emissions. For coherent and effective measures on the ground, investment needs should be addressed in a systematic way at all levels — European, national and local. Coherent and complete disclosure of climate risks by companies is a pre-requisite for making informed investment decisions. In addition to improving transparency on climate risks, long-term planning and commitment also send clear signals to investors.   Clear policy signals facilitate long-term investments   The 2015 Paris agreement has set the global objective to ‘make all financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low-emissions, climate-resilient development’. This objective was also confirmed by the 2016 climate change conference in Marrakesh.   The  clean energy package , recently proposed by the European Commission, confirms the EU’s commitment to a low-carbon and climate-resilient transition. The package expounds the target of at least 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions and proposes the targets of at least 30% for energy efficiency and of at least 27% for renewable energy by 2030. It also highlights the important role that investments in clean energy transition and their economic co-benefits. According to the European Commission, by mobilising up to EUR 177 billion of public and private investment per year from 2021, the proposed package can generate up to a 1% increase in GDP over the next decade and create 900 000 new jobs.   The EU policy framework and targets are in general implemented through strategies and concrete actions in the countries, including the national Low Carbon Development Strategies. A preliminary assessment of these strategies by the EEA shows that they vary considerably in scope and depth as well as ambition level. They include very limited information on financing needs and plans to redirect investments. Moreover, a long-term vision at national level in line with EU’s decarbonisation targets is often lacking. Similarly, many countries have also adopted national adaptation strategies and action plans, but details on financing these are often not available. To strengthen investors’ confidence, the Low Carbon Development Strategies and national adaptation plans should be complemented with national climate financing strategies.   Public sector investments will not be enough for financing the transition but can help mobilise and leverage private capital, which is indispensable for redirecting investment at the scale needed. At least 20 % of the EU’s 2014-2020 budget is earmarked to climate-related action. The  EU’s recent decision  to extend and increase the European Funds for Strategic Investments and the recently  established high level group  on sustainable finance are also important steps towards building a finance system fostering sustainability in Europe.   Finance system to offer innovative solutions   Climate financing strategies require the involvement of different stakeholders — public and private — at all levels, including the local level. The finance system also needs to evolve to cater to different types of needs and different sources.   Some European municipalities have already come up with innovative ways to fund their actions by combining different funding sources or developing new ones such as crowdfunding of climate bonds. According to our upcoming assessment, however, many municipalities still face difficulties to find finance for their climate adaptation actions. The lack of capacity and expertise in finding sources and applying for the most suitable type of finance poses an important barrier among others. Moreover, in many cases, climate adaptation measures are not yet considered as ‘profitable investments’ by financial decision-makers.   Increasing awareness of climate risks and of the additional benefits of adaptation measures (e.g. boosting quality of life and the attractiveness of the place benefitting from such measures) might result in a different assessment of what constitutes a good investment.   EEA and climate finance   Given the vital role of climate finance in making the necessary transition happen in Europe, the EEA is working towards assessing the connections between current and future actions for mitigation and adaptation on the one hand, and the finance and fiscal systems on the other. A greater understanding of these connections is a prerequisite for removing barriers to climate finance and redirecting funds to support low-carbon climate-resilient transition.

"air-quality-remains-a-hot  Air quality remains a hot topic for many Europeans  Last month the European Environment Agency (EEA) released its latest ‘Air quality in Europe’ report which showed that while air quality is slowly improving, air pollution remains the single largest environmental health hazard in Europe. We sat down with Alberto González Ortiz, an EEA air quality expert, to discuss the report’s findings and how technologies like satellite imagery are helping to improve air quality research.   What were the key findings of the 2016 report?   This year’s report highlights the fact that concentrations of air pollution across Europe continue to slowly improve. However, we are still seeing significant effects on health. Air pollution continues to result in a lower quality of life due to illnesses. Our updated report also provides a new estimate of the health impacts of the most harmful air pollutants like PM 2.5  which was responsible for estimated 467,000 premature deaths per year in 2013 across 41 European countries.   The health hazards of air pollution are well known, thanks to organisations like the World Health Organization, and people across Europe are increasingly aware that the problem is a serious one. We are exposed to it every day. You don’t see it but you can really feel it when air pollution levels are high.   What about road transport and air pollution in cities?    The report highlights the impact of road transport on air pollution, which has been in the news recently in connection with several European cities, including Paris and London.   Road transport is the main emitter of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) which is one of the main pollutants harming health. This pollutant is also a precursor of ozone and particulate matter that can form in the air. Transport is also an important source of primary particulate matter, not only due to fuel combustion, but also by the wear of tyres and brakes, and last but not least, transport is a very important source of greenhouse gas emissions.   Road transport also takes up a large part of our public spaces, take traffic congestion for example. It causes noise as well. So, it’s a multidimensional problem.   Of course, no one questions the important role transport and mobility play in our everyday lives, but getting around can be made more sustainable. We are seeing that many cities are already taking action across Europe, trying to set up more sustainable mobility systems. Measures like congestion charges are short-term remedies, so we have to consider longer-term fundamental and innovative changes to our transport system to improve our overall well-being.   The reports also draws attention to emissions from residential and commercial buildings. How big of a problem are they?    As far as wood stoves and fireplaces are concerned, it’s a bigger problem than people might think, particularly in winter time. Many people, especially in eastern and northern Europe, light their fireplaces or wood stoves, which emit a lot of PM 2.5 . Fuel combustion of all types for heating households, commercial and other institutional buildings is actually the largest emitter of PM 2.5 . The entire sector emits more than half of the total PM 2.5  at the European level.   Another problem in winter can be that in calm weather conditions, most of these emissions tend to hang and stay close to the ground because of thermal inversion. Under these conditions colder air stays in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Colder air, which is thicker, prevents the mixing and dispersion of emissions upwards in the atmosphere, so the pollution stays close to the ground.   What is the EEA doing to improve air quality in Europe?   One of the main contributions of the EEA is to provide the knowledge and the data required to help policy makers make better informed decisions on air quality. And our work also helps to raise public awareness of the problem, which is equally important.   We collect official data on air pollution from European countries, which we then use to make our regular air quality assessments via reports and indicators. We also share our air pollution data with many other stakeholders including the general public, national or regional authorities and the EU’s Copernicus satellite programme. And we participate regularly in seminars, conferences and meetings across Europe and internationally to share and discuss the issue and our findings, which help to spur action by policy makers. Air pollution is linked to a wide range of policy areas, so one of our priorities is to promote integrated cross-sectoral policies and measures.   Are any new technologies used to improve the monitoring of air pollution?   The vast majority of our data is collected through fixed air quality monitoring stations, which are operated by national and local authorities in our member countries. However, we are now seeing the use of other technologies as well, such as data collection by the use of satellites under the EU’s Copernicus programme. This is fairly new. The EEA works with Copernicus atmospheric services, and in the EEA air quality team, we also use some of this data in our work. By combining the information from satellites with modelling, we can get a better spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations. So instead of getting data at certain intervals from only certain measuring stations, we can get a much wider picture. But it’s essential to confirm model results with real-life observations, and this is where the EEA’s data received from countries across Europe is imperative.   We are also starting to see grass-roots, citizen-driven monitoring of air pollution with the use of sensors.

However, we are still seeing significant effects on health. Air pollution continues to result in a lower quality of life due to illnesses. Our updated report also provides a new estimate of the health impacts of the most harmful air pollutants like PM<sub>2.5 </sub>which was responsible for estimated 467,000 premature deaths per year in 2013 across 41 European countries.</p> <p>The health hazards of air pollution are well known, thanks to organisations like the World Health Organization, and people across Europe are increasingly aware that the problem is a serious one. We are exposed to it every day. You don’t see it but you can really feel it when air pollution levels are high.</p> <h3><b>What about road transport and air pollution in cities? </b></h3> <p>The report highlights the impact of road transport on air pollution, which has been in the news recently in connection with several European cities, including Paris and London.</p> <p>Road transport is the main emitter of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) which is one of the main pollutants harming health. This pollutant is also a precursor of ozone and particulate matter that can form in the air. Transport is also an important source of primary particulate matter, not only due to fuel combustion, but also by the wear of tyres and brakes, and last but not least, transport is a very important source of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Road transport also takes up a large part of our public spaces, take traffic congestion for example. It causes noise as well. So, it’s a multidimensional problem.</p> <p>Of course, no one questions the important role transport and mobility play in our everyday lives, but getting around can be made more sustainable. We are seeing that many cities are already taking action across Europe, trying to set up more sustainable mobility systems. Measures like congestion charges are short-term remedies, so we have to consider longer-term fundamental and innovative changes to our transport system to improve our overall well-being.</p> <h3><b>The reports also draws attention to emissions from residential and commercial buildings. How big of a problem are they? </b></h3> <p>As far as wood stoves and fireplaces are concerned, it’s a bigger problem than people might think, particularly in winter time. Many people, especially in eastern and northern Europe, light their fireplaces or wood stoves, which emit a lot of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Fuel combustion of all types for heating households, commercial and other institutional buildings is actually the largest emitter of PM<sub>2.5</sub>. The entire sector emits more than half of the total PM<sub>2.5</sub> at the European level.</p> <p>Another problem in winter can be that in calm weather conditions, most of these emissions tend to hang and stay close to the ground because of thermal inversion. Under these conditions colder air stays in the lower layers of the atmosphere. Colder air, which is thicker, prevents the mixing and dispersion of emissions upwards in the atmosphere, so the pollution stays close to the ground.</p> <h3><b>What is the EEA doing to improve air quality in Europe?</b></h3> <p>One of the main contributions of the EEA is to provide the knowledge and the data required to help policy makers make better informed decisions on air quality. And our work also helps to raise public awareness of the problem, which is equally important.</p> <p>We collect official data on air pollution from European countries, which we then use to make our regular air quality assessments via reports and indicators. We also share our air pollution data with many other stakeholders including the general public, national or regional authorities and the EU’s Copernicus satellite programme. And we participate regularly in seminars, conferences and meetings across Europe and internationally to share and discuss the issue and our findings, which help to spur action by policy makers. Air pollution is linked to a wide range of policy areas, so one of our priorities is to promote integrated cross-sectoral policies and measures.</p> <h3><b>Are any new technologies used to improve the monitoring of air pollution?</b></h3> <p>The vast majority of our data is collected through fixed air quality monitoring stations, which are operated by national and local authorities in our member countries. However, we are now seeing the use of other technologies as well, such as data collection by the use of satellites under the EU’s Copernicus programme. This is fairly new. The EEA works with Copernicus atmospheric services, and in the EEA air quality team, we also use some of this data in our work. By combining the information from satellites with modelling, we can get a better spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations. So instead of getting data at certain intervals from only certain measuring stations, we can get a much wider picture. But it’s essential to confirm model results with real-life observations, and this is where the EEA’s data received from countries across Europe is imperative.</p> <p>We are also starting to see grass-roots, citizen-driven monitoring of air pollution with the use of sensors. It is a new source of information, but the accuracy of these devices still needs to be improved. They are not totally reliable yet, but it’s an emerging technology and it’s a great way of raising public awareness and community participation in addressing air pollution problems. At some point, this technology might become a good complementary source of information as well.</p> <p> <img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/articles/air-quality-remains-a-hot/copy_of_Alberto.jpg/@@images/9370e84a-0293-499e-9336-a11b2f7caaf8.jpeg' alt='Alberto GONZÁLEZ ORTIZ' class='image-inline' title='Alberto GONZÁLEZ ORTIZ' /></p> <p><strong>Alberto González Ortiz</strong></p> <p>The interview published in the <a class='external-link' href='http://createsend.com/t/d-6F4562733AFE9600' target='_self' title=''>EEA Newsletter 04/2016, December 2016</a></p>","Air quality remains a hot topic for many Europeans",,"Last month the European Environment Agency (EEA) released its latest ‘Air quality in Europe’ report which showed that while air quality is slowly improving, air pollution remains the single largest environmental health hazard in Europe.

"term-2016-fundamental-changes-needed  TERM 2016: Fundamental changes needed for sustainable mobility   What changes are needed in order to move towards a more sustainable mobility system in Europe? A European Environment Agency (EEA) report released today assesses the latest environmental trends in transport and presents examples of the different transitions needed in terms of technology, urban planning and societal behaviour to make transport more sustainable.   The EEA report ‘ TERM 2016: Transitions towards a more sustainable mobility system ’ assesses the progress that European Union Member States are making to improve the environmental performance of transport in line with related EU policy targets. The report also looks at the big changes underway in the sector, from emerging technologies such as  electric  and driverless cars, to recent innovations that are becoming increasingly popular, such as shared or on-demand mobility services for commuters.   It is clear that Europe’s environment will continue to face transport-related pressures, such as air pollution, biodiversity fragmentation, traffic congestion, inefficient use of urban space and noise. Transport activity across Europe is expected to continue growing under current trends and policies. From 2010 to 2050, it is estimated that passenger transport will grow by about 40 %, with aviation as the fastest growing sector. Freight transport is expected to grow by 58 %. Consistent with these outlooks, greenhouse gas emissions under current policies are forecast to increase slightly between 2030 and 2050 to 15 % above 1990 levels, significantly higher than the  60 % reduction target proposed for 2050 . Reaching Europe’s long term environmental targets will therefore still require substantial efforts.   So what changes can society make to our mobility system to significantly improve its sustainability? The report stresses that while technological developments will continue to largely determine the future environmental performance of the transport sector, many past beneficial technological advances have historically been offset by the ever increasing demand for transport. Meeting decarbonisation and other environmental goals for the sector requires not only incremental changes such as improvements to the fuel efficiency of road vehicles, planes and ships, but also more far reaching changes, such as the widespread introduction of electric vehicles and changes to lifestyles and habits which greatly influence the way that society uses transport.   Looking to the future, the report identifies the scale of change required, in terms of transport’s environmental performance, in order to meet the EU’s long-term decarbonisation targets for 2050. It also looks at the strong links and interdependencies between the transport system and the food, land use and tourism sectors. Various barriers and ‘lock-ins’ that can hold up or delay the shift to a more sustainable mobility system are presented. One clear example of a ‘lock-in’ is society’s continued dependence on the fossil-fuel powered internal combustion engine, coupled with continued investments in traditional road transport infrastructure, which can hamper efforts to shift to more sustainable modes of transport.   Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism (TERM)   The annual TERM reports published by EEA use the latest available European data in order to assess key trends, measures and overall progress of the transport sector towards its environmental policy targets. Each year, the reports also address a specific issue.

"exceedances-of-air-quality-objectives-9  Exceedances of air quality objectives due to traffic        It is still a challenge to achieve good air quality levels in Europe, especially in urban areas with high volumes of road traffic.   Despite considerable improvements over recent decades, air pollution is still responsible for around 467 000 premature deaths in Europe each year. It also continues to damage vegetation and ecosystems.   Transport contributes significantly to the emission of many air pollutants and the resulting poor air quality, particularly in urban areas with high road traffic volumes.   The annual EU limit value for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2  ), one of the main air quality pollutants of concern and typically associated with vehicle emissions, was widely exceeded across Europe in 2014, with 94 % of all exceedances occurring at roadside monitoring locations.    In 2014, 16% of the EU-28 urban population were exposed to PM 10  levels above the EU daily limit value, whereas 8% were exposed to PM  2.5  levels above the EU target value.In 2014, transport also contributed to15 % and24 % of the total PM  10   and PM  2.5   primary emissions, respectively, in the EU Member States.

Actions to improve air quality need to take account of local composition to ensure targeted measures are implemented. For example, buses, mopeds and motorcycles make up a higher proportion of vehicle composition in urban areas than they do nationally. Buses can emit high levels of NOx and PM unless measures are taken to ensure they meet strict emission standards. Mopeds and motorcycles are high emitters of carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organiccompounds (VOC), particularly older models.</span></p> <p class='Pa14'>In addition, 'slow, stop and start' congested urban traffic conditions and frequent short journeys can result in higher emissions per kilometre compared with free-flowing longer journeys. This is a consequence of increased cold engine operation, and the higher fuel consumption and less efficient performance of exhaust emission abatement systems. Measures to reduce traffic congestion may therefore also benefit air quality in the immediate area, although the full impacts need to be assessed over a wider area to ensure that traffic and emissions are not simply moved elsewhere.</p> <p class='Pa14'>Other characteristics of the urban environment can increase the impact of traffic emissions on air quality. For example, the presence of high buildings on either side of roads, common in many city centres, creates a 'street canyon', which reduces the dispersion of the pollutants emitted from traffic sources and can lead to significantly higher concentrations locally.</p> <p class='Pa14'>The monitoring data reported by the countries (Air Quality e-Reporting Database (http://<a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting'><span><span>www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/aqereporting</span></span></a>)) provide the basis for estimating exposure of the urban European population to exceedances of the most stringent European air quality standards and WHO guidelines. Exposure is estimated based on concentrations measured at all urban and suburban background monitoring stations for most of the urban population, and at traffic stations for populations living within 100 m of major roads.

"fluorinated-gases-continue-to-be  Fluorinated gases continue to be phased down in Europe  The production, import and export of fluorinated-gases (F-gases) continued to decline in the European Union, according to a new report published today by the European Environment Agency (EEA). F-gases, which are mainly used in cooling and heating equipment, have a high global warming potential and their phase-down is therefore essential to global efforts to mitigate climate change.   F-gases were in many cases introduced to replace chemicals that were found to be harming the ozone layer. Currently, F-gases are mainly used in refrigerators, heat pumps and air-conditioning equipment in buildings and in cars.   The EEA report  ‘Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2015 ’ tracks progress towards the EU target of reducing F-gas emissions by two thirds by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. According to the report, the production, imports, exports and supply of F-gases in the EU decreased in 2015, both in physical amounts as well as in amounts weighted by the global warming potential of the gas in question, measured in CO 2 -equivalent tonnes (CO 2 -eq.).   The F-gas share of the global warming potential of the EU’s overall greenhouse gas emissions was 3 % in 2014, but this share has been on the increase. Curbing F-gas emissions is therefore an important part of the EU’s overall commitment to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.   Large reductions in F-gas use and emissions are expected from a new phase-down measure, which will progressively cap the sales of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) on the EU market down to 21 % of baseline levels by 2030. Furthermore, bans on the use of F-gases that have a high global warming potential are expected to result in additional reductions.   The Montreal Protocol to reduce the production and consumption of ozone depleting substances was amended to regulate HFCs, in October 2016, in Kigali, Rwanda. Both developed and developing countries have taken on mandatory commitments to reduce production and consumption of HFCs in the next three decades.   Key findings of ‘Fluorinated greenhouse gases 2015’, based on reporting by companies in the EU:     Production of F-gases in the EU declined by 5 % (as  CO  2  -eq. ) in 2015.   F-gas imports to the EU decreased by about 40 %, compared with the exceptionally high amounts reported in 2014 (both by weight and as  CO  2  -eq. ).   EU exports of F-gases decreased by 2 % (by weight) or 1 % ( CO  2  -eq. ) compared with 2014. However, compared to 2013, exports in 2015 increased by 18 % (by weight) and 23 % ( CO  2  -eq. ).

"assessment  Waste recycling   Latest available trends show that recycling ratesfor both municipal waste and packaging waste have increased substantially: recycling rates for municipal waste increased by 13 percentage points between 2004 and 2014, and recycling rates for packaging waste by 10 percentage points between 2005 and 2013. In 2014, 43 % of the municipal waste generated in the EU-27 and Norway was recycled, while in 2013, 65 % of packaging waste generated was recycled. These improvements are, among others, driven by EU targets for the recycling of these two waste streams introduced in 1994 and 2008, respectively. Higher overall recycling rates for packaging waste compared to municipal waste probably result from the earlier introduction of packaging waste targets, producer responsibility schemes and the relative ease of recycling packaging waste from commercial sources.   For municipal waste, large differences in recycling rates between European countries prevail; in 2014, the rates ranged from 64 % in Germany to 1 % in Serbia. In six countries, recycling rates were equal or higher than 50 %, while five countries recycled less than 20 %.  In 2014, 24 countries recycled 55 % or morepackaging waste  and overall recycling rates ranged from 81 % in Belgium to 41 % in Malta.

This approach is a key way to extract more value from resources, and recycling plays a crucial role. The main aim is to increasingly meet the material demand of the economy by using secondary raw materials made of recycled waste, preventing the environmental impacts associated with extracting and refining virgin materials, and contributing to the security of supply.</p> <p>This indicator shows how theprogress Europe is making towards the goal to recycle more waste, using municipal solid waste (in the text called municipal waste) and packaging waste as examples.</p> <p>For these two waste streams, legally binding quantitative targets for recycling exist in EU legislation. The Waste Framework Directive sets a target of 50 % of municipal waste (more precisely the target applies to specific types of household and similar wastes) to be recycled by 2020 in individual countries (except Turkey and Switzerland). The Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC) requires EU Member States to recycle at least 55 % of packaging waste by 2008. Several countries have different target years for meeting the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive targets: 2012 for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia; 2013 for Malta; 2014 for Poland; 2015 for Latvia. In addition, Romania and Bulgaria have been granted specific derogations, defined in their respective Treaties of Accession. In December 2015, the European Commission proposed a new set of more ambitious targets for recycling of both municipal and packaging waste, as part of its circular economy strategy.</p> <p>The recycling rate of <strong>municipal waste</strong> grew continuously by 13 percentage points in the EU-27 countries and Norway in the period 2004-2014 (Figure 1), which clearly indicates improvements in waste management. In 2014, 43 % of municipal waste generated in the EU-27 and Norway was recycled, including both material recycling and composting, and anaerobic digestion.</p> <p>The difference in municipal waste recycling performance between the countries with the highest and lowest recycling rates is large. In 2014, rates ranged from 64 % in Germany to 1 % in Serbia (Figure 2). Six countries, notably Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, achieved (in descending order) recycling rates of 50 % or higher, while another six countries recycled less than 20 %, including two countries with less than 10 %. Ten countries  the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and the United Kingdom  made substantial progress, with an increase in recycling rates of over 15 percentage points between 2004 and 2014. In nine countries, the share of recycled municipal waste has barely changed since 2004 (less than five percentage points change). It is important to note that these recycling rates cannot be used to assess the countries progress against the 50 % recycling target of the Waste Framework Directive, because countries can choose between four different methods to calculate compliance with the target. The data shown in figures 1 and 2 only show recycling rates according to one of those methods, the only one where time-series data is available. Moreover<span>, the target in the Waste Framework Directive includes preparing for reuse while this is not included in the data used in this indicator.</span></p> <p>Developments in the area of <b>packaging waste</b> are similar to those in municipal waste: the recycling rate of packaging waste grew from 55 % in 2004 to 65 % in 2013, i.e. by 10 percentage points in the EU-27 and Norway (Figure 1). </p> <p>At the county level, 24 countries recycled 55 % or more of their packaging waste in 2014 (Figure 3). The recycling rate in 2014 varied from 81 % in Belgium to 41 % in Malta, but on average, the differences (measured as standard deviation) in recycling rates between countries has decreased since 2004. The highest increases since 2004 were of over 30 percentage points and they occurred in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia, which indicates that these countries have caught up quickly. Another nine countries managed to increase their recycling rates by more than 15 percentage points. In Austria, Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg - countries with high recycling rates already in 2004 - recycling increased by less than five percentage points.</p> <p>Hungary and Malta missed their targets in 2014, Greece in 2013, and Iceland in 2012. Greece and Iceland had to meet the target by 2008, Hungary by 2012, and Malta by 2013.</p> <p>It seems that the introduction and implementation of EU and national policies and targets have acted as drivers for the improvements made in the past years. However, regional and local policies within countries continue to play a significant role in the process. Recycling rates for packaging waste are consistently higher than for municipal waste, and differences in recycling rates between countries are higher for municipal waste than for packaging waste (measured as standard deviation). One reason for this is that targets for packaging waste recycling were already introduced in 1994, with 2001 and 2008 as target years, while the recycling target for municipal waste was only introduced in 2008 and has to be met by 2020. In addition, the target for packaging waste is more ambitious than that for municipal waste. The majority of countries introduced producer responsibility schemes for packaging waste, thus creating a mechanism for moving towards the targets. Moreover, packaging waste from households was, in many countries, the first waste type targeted for recycling of municipal waste. Finally, packaging waste from commercial sources is easier to recycle because it contains larger and cleaner streams than municipal waste. However, it should be kept in mind that the two waste streams overlap as municipal waste includes packaging waste from households and similar sources.</p> <p><span>All in all, while there is considerable progress reported by the countries for both waste streams, there is still room for further improvement - both for packaging and municipal waste - on the road to a circular economy.</span></p>","Waste recycling",,"Latest available trends show that recycling ratesfor both municipal waste and packaging waste have increased substantially: recycling rates for municipal waste increased by 13 percentage points between 2004 and 2014, and recycling rates for packaging waste by 10 percentage points between 2005 and 2013. In 2014, 43 % of the municipal waste generated in the EU-27 and Norway was recycled, while in 2013, 65 % of packaging waste generated was recycled. These improvements are, among others, driven by EU targets for the recycling of these two waste streams introduced in 1994 and 2008, respectively. Higher overall recycling rates for packaging waste compared to municipal waste probably result from the earlier introduction of packaging waste targets, producer responsibility schemes and the relative ease of recycling packaging waste from commercial sources.   For municipal waste, large differences in recycling rates between European countries prevail; in 2014, the rates ranged from 64 % in Germany to 1 % in Serbia. In six countries, recycling rates were equal or higher than 50 %, while five countries recycled less than 20 %.  In 2014, 24 countries recycled 55 % or morepackaging waste  and overall recycling rates ranged from 81 % in Belgium to 41 % in Malta. These differences indicate a large potential for improvement.","2016-12-13T08:55:00Z","2017-01-05T11:08:08Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Liechtenstein,Luxembourg,Austria,Cyprus,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Czech Republic,France,Hungary,Norway,Germany,Greece,Netherlands,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Serbia,Lithuania,Belgium,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Resource efficiency and waste","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/waste-recycling-1/assessment","Indicator assessment","2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

Preserving andrestoring species of European interest, which constitute an important part of the EUs biodiversity, is a key element, not only for the intrinsic value of these protected species, but also because protecting their habitats supports a wider range of biodiversity and contributes to ensuring the continued delivery of ecosystem services  water purification, pollination, recreation etc.  which benefit EU citizens.    Policy targets and progress    In line with the 7th EAP objective, the overall aim of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (EC, 2011) includes halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020. The EU Birds and Habitats Directives (EU, 1992 and 2009) aim to ensure that species of European interest are maintained or restored to good status throughout their natural range within the EU. Target 1 of the Biodiversity Strategy sets out the specific goal that, by 2020, 34% of species assessed under the Habitats Directive should have a favourable or improved conservation status, and that 78% of species assessed under the Birds Directive should have a secure or improved status.   The latest assessments (covering the 20072012 period) for the conservation status and trends for species under the Habitats Directive show that the total proportion of these species having either favourable (23%) or improved (4%) status was 27% (the adjusted 2020 target is 34.5%). A total of 22% are still deteriorating and 14% are without a known trend.   As can be seen inFigure1, the majority of species are assessed as being in unfavourable status (60%). For all taxonomic groups, moreover, the number of species whose status is deteriorating is significantly higher than those whose status is improving towards favourable status. The largest negative trend is observed in fish, molluscs and amphibians. With more than 66% of assessments categorised as unknown and only 7% as favourable, the status of marine species gives rise to particular concern.      Figure 1: Conservation status and trends for species assessed as unfavourable under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), EU         For birds, the total proportion of species assessments with either secure status (52%) or non-secure but improving status (8.5%) was around 61% of species (the target for 2020 is 78%). The proportion of secure species did not change compared with the assessment in 2004 (EC, 2015; EEA, 2015a).   The EU population status of bird species (see Figure2)indicates that around 15% are near threatened, declining or depleted, while another 17% of species are threatened. It should also be noted that the EU population status for another 17% of bird species remains unknown. Populations of some common birds appear to be stabilising but other species  especially those linked to fragile freshwater, coastal and agricultural ecosystems  continue to decline (EC, 2015).        Figure 2: EU population status of bird species        There has been limited progress, with recovery of some species due to dedicated conservation efforts and improved site management. The EU-wide network of nature conservation areas (Natura 2000) has been expanded to cover 18% of EU land and is now considered complete (the coverage of protected marine areas has increased to 6% but still requires additional effort). Conserving and managing the Natura 2000 network effectively through implementation of conservation measures under the Birds and Habitats Directives is central to improving the conservation status of EU protected species. It is also important to enhance the networks coherence through developing green infrastructure, such as wildlife corridors.   Nonetheless, EU protected species continue to face many pressures: the highest ranked pressures and threats to terrestrial species are reported to be agriculture (including both intensification and abandonment) and changes to hydrology (especially in wetlands) (EEA, 2015a). Many of these threats and pressures arise from a wide range of sectors and policies (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry, transport etc.) and are expected to continue. Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is closely intertwined with developments in these areas, including implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy reform. The adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors and regional policies therefore remains critical in attempting to reduce pressures on biodiversity (EEA, 2015b).   Given the limited progress in improving the conservation status of species and the ongoing cumulative pressures on their habitats, it is unlikely that the 2020 target will be met.    Country level information    At the EU Member States level, almost half of the countries have 30% or less of species assessments considered asfavourable, and only four Member States (Ireland, Bulgaria, Estonia and Cyprus) have more than 50% of species assessments as favourable (see Figure3). Theproportion of species assessments classified as unfavourabledeclining exceeds 20% innine countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden, while for Italy up to 40% of its species assessments are classified as unfavourabledeclining (see Figure3).       Figure 3: Conservation status and trends of species assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), by country        Outlook beyond 2020   Dedicated conservation efforts under the Habitats and Birds Directives can be expected to result in the recovery of some species, but achieving favourable conservation status for all EU protected species in the longer term is very challenging. Many species are expected to continue their decline beyond 2020 since widespread pressures are expected to be ongoing. Intensification of agriculture is expected to continue or increase in Eastern Europe, for example, and some pressures (including climate change and invasive alien species) are set to increase. The fate of marine species is a particular concern given the high proportion of unknown assessments and given also that a substantial increase in the network of marine protected areas still needs to be implemented.   About the indicator   This indicator covers the status of and trends in: (1) around 450 wild bird species that are naturally present in the EU (Birds Directive, EU, 2009); and (2) more than 1250 other species of wild animals and plants (Habitats Directive, EU, 1992) considered to be rare, threatened or endemic. The protected species are often collectively referred to as species of European interest. They cover many taxonomic groups, trophic levels and habitats.   Conservation status of species under the Habitats Directive is assessed every 6 years (latest period 20072012) at the national and EU biogeographical levels. Population status of species of the Birds Directive is also assessed every 6 years (latest period 20082012) at the EU level.   Assessments cover the status of the species and their evolution during this period (trend). The indicator thus reflects combined results forboth status and trend.   For bird species, the population status is categorised as secured, near threatened, declining or depleted, threatened or unknown, and conservation trends (for near threatened, declining or depleted and threatened species) categorised as increasing, stable, fluctuating, deteriorating, or unknown.   For other species, conservation status is categorised as favourable, unfavourableinadequate, unfavourablebad and unknown, and conservation trends (for unfavourable assessments) as unfavourableimproving, unfavourablestable, unfavourabledeteriorating and unfavourableunknown.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span><span><strong>EU indicator past trend <br /><br /></strong></span></span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</strong> <br /><br /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Species of European interest</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-triangle-deteriorating-trend/@@images/7f0c4bbe-354c-4a58-942a-26561fbaebd4.jpeg' alt='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' class='image-inline' title='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' /></em></p> <p align='center'></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Ensure that 34 % of species assessments under the Habitats Directive are in a favourable or improved conservation status, and that 78 % of species assessments under the Birds Directive show a secure or improved status  EU Biodiversity Strategy.</p> </td> <td> <p><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>The EU has shown limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected species and the pressures on species remain.

This briefing presents trends in EPE; promotingactivities and technologies aimed at preventing pollution and environmental degradation can reduce the environmental and climate impacts of economic activity. This can also lead to economic development via growth and increasing employment in the environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) ( AIRS_PO2.12, 2016 ). 1  However, increased spending can also reflect responses to growing environmental pressures and impacts on the environment.          Policy targets and progress        The 7th EAP Priority Objective 6 identifies the need to increase both public and private sector environment and climate-related expenditure.EPE has grown over the 20032013 period by 18% in real terms, although most of this growth took place before 2008 (Figure1). The proportions of expenditure of the public sector, industry and specialised producers (a mixture of public and privately run environmental specialist services such as waste and wastewater companies) remained relatively constant over the same period. Specialised producers accounted for half of total expenditure, industry for 20% and the public sector for 30%. Expenditure by industry has lagged behind the other two sectors, growing at half the speed.   Overall EPE experienced a dip due to the financial crisis and did not recover to 2008 levels in real terms (fixed prices) until 2011. However, the reduction was mainly driven by industry and specialised providers. Public expenditure actually increased during and immediately following the crisis as governments in EU Member States tried tostabilisetheir economies by increasing investments, includinggreen investments (Grlach et al., 2014). This increasing trend in EPE in the public sector also protected the EGSS in Europe from the economic downturn ( AIRS_PO2.12, 2016 ). 1  However, it should be noted that the main reason for growth in the EGSS was a continuous increase in renewable energy activities, and the EPE indicator does not capture this.       Figure 1. Trends in EU-28 environmental protection expenditure by organisation type, in absolute value (2010 fixed prices) and proportion of GDP          Public expenditure on environment activities as part of policy interventions to stabilise economies also affected the proportion of overall EPE in GDP. This showed a 7% increase over the 20032013 period with a peak in 2009, following 2 years of increased government expenditure (from EUR85 billion in 2007 to EUR90 billion in 2009), while the overall economy shrank. Public sector EPE then dropped toEUR86 billion in 2010 (at 2010 prices),then stagnated after 2009 as the economy began to grow again, reducing the EPE proportion of GDP to 2006 levels by 2013.    Figure 2. Environmental protection expenditure by specialised producers and the public sector split by environmental domain, EU        Figure2 shows EPE trends according to environmental domain in the same period. Data are available only for the public sector and specialised producers (approximately 80% of overall EPE).   Most expenditure was on waste management, followed by wastewater treatment. The growth in EPE has been driven primarily by growth in waste management expenditure. EPE related to air pollution and climate was very limited but this is in part due to industry expenditure not being included in the figures. If this was included, it would add an extra EUR12 billion EPE in 2013, in addition to the EUR4 billion spent on air and climate, as shown in Figure2 (Eurostat, 2015a).    The EPE will only partly capture climate-related expenditure. Nevertheless, given current EU budgetallocation commitments and the clear increase in EPE since 2003, it seems unlikely that this trend will be reversed by 2020. Therefore, the prospects for increased environmental expenditure by 2020 appear positive.        Country level information          Figure3 shows  developments at country level in total EPE as percentages of GDP in the 20032013 period, where data are available. While trends varied between countries, of the 11 countries with data for all 3 years, eight saw increasing proportions of GDP.      Figure 3. Environmental protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP        EPE as a proportion of GDP varies strongly across countries.Austria, Estonia, Italy and Romania have proportions over 3% whileSerbia and Turkey have proportions lower than 0.75% (Figure3). This wide gap reflects differences in economic structure (e.g. type of industry, type of energy sources used). In most countries, public sector expenditure is concentrated on waste management and wastewater treatment.   The division between EPE current expenditure and investment differs across countries according to the date when they entered the EU. For Member States that have joined the EU since 2004, investment accounts for more than 35% of total EPE. Thisexpenditurecan be explained by the new fixed assets necessary to meet EU water quality and waste management directives.    Outlook beyond 2020    Progress towards a circular economy will require increases in investments and current expenditure in the waste management sector, but also within the business sector as a whole, to close resource loops. The EU intends to invest EUR5.5 billion of structural funds in accelerating the circular economy (EC, 2015). This could also provide a catalyst for expenditure by the public sector and businesses in Member States up to and beyond 2020.   The EUs agreed long-term target (EC, 2014) for further reducing greenhouse gas emissions (a 40% reduction compared with 1990 by 2030) also implies additional investments, not all of which will be captured by the EPE indicator. The air quality targets for 2030 proposed by theEuropean Commission in late 2013 (A Clean Air Programme for Europe; EC, 2013b) could also lead to an increase in EPE beyond 2020. Additional efforts will be needed beyond 2020 to achieve the water quality targets of the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) which are also likely to be reflected in an increase in EPE.   About the indicator   This briefing uses data from the environmental protection expenditure account (EPEA), which is one of the European environmental accounts. Environmental accounts analyse the interaction between the economy and the environment by organising environmental information in a way that is consistent with national accounts.EPE illustrates the investments aimed at preventing, reducing and eliminating pollution and environmental degradation. The EPE indicator estimates country spending on these activities in fixed prices (2010 reference year) in euros and as a percentage of GDP.   EPE data are available by environmental domain (protection of ambient air and climate; wastewater management; waste management; protection and remediation of soil, groundwater and surface water; noise and vibration abatement; protection of biodiversity and landscape; protection against radiation; research and development; and other environmental protection activities). EPE data are also available by type of organisation (public, industrial and specialist producers, which can be a mixture of public and privately run environmental specialist services such as waste management companies etc.). EPE can also be split between investments and current (ongoing) expenditure.   European environmental accounts are established by Regulation 691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts.From 2017, reporting of data on the EPEA will be mandatory and standardised. Currently, data on expenditure by certain sectors, particularly industry, is missing in some years for some countries, and in these cases it is estimated by Eurostat. Moreover, industry EPE data broken down by environmental domain are missing.    Although the EPEA includes investment in reducing air pollutants (including greenhouse gases), it does not capture investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency or any form of climate adaptation. Therefore it does not fully capture expenditure to achieve climate policy objectives.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p style='text-align: center; '><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><strong>Indicative outlook</strong><br /><strong>of the EU meeting</strong><br /><strong>the selected</strong><br /><strong>objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Environmental protection expenditure in Europe</p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></span></p> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '>(% of GDP)</span></p> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '><span style='text-align: left; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></span>(absolute value at fixed prices)</span><span style='text-align: left; '></span></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p align='center'><span>Increase in public and private sector funding for environment- and climate-related expenditure - 7th EAP<br /></span></p> </td> <td width='121'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' alt='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' class='image-inline' title='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' /></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p>Environmental protection expenditure has increased over the years and this seems likely to continue to 2020, strengthened by the EU's decision that at least 20 % of its 20142020 budget should be used on climate change activities</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <div class='pageBreak'></div> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>The 7th EAP calls for an increase in both public and private sector environment- and climate-related expenditure to achieve environment and climate objectives (EU, 2013).

According to a scenario assuming that current legislation is fully implemented, it will, nevertheless, fall short of the 2020 objective             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016             Setting the Scene    The 7th EAP ( EU, 2013 ) includes the objective of reducing the impact of air pollution on ecosystems and biodiversity, with the long-term aim of not exceeding critical loads and levels. Currently, the most important impact of air pollution on ecosystems and biodiversity is eutrophication caused by airborne nitrogen pollution.Excessive atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems results in loss of sensitive species, increased growth of species that benefit from high nutrient levels, changes to habitat structure and function, the homogenisation of vegetation types, etc.    Policy targets and progress    The EU Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution includes an objective for 2020 of a 43% reduction in areas or ecosystems exposed to eutrophication, i.e. areas where eutrophication critical loads are exceeded  (  EC, 2005 a ) . The reference measure for this objective is the area in exceedance in 2000 ( EC, 2005 b). This is in line with the long-term objective of not exceeding critical loads.    In 2000, the area of ecosystems where the critical load was exceeded was almost 70% of the total in the EU Member States (approximately 60% in all 33 EEA member countries for which data were available, including the 28 EU Member States) and decreased in 2010 to 63% in the EU (55% in all 33 EEA member countries). Assuming that current legislation is fully implemented, the area in exceedance is projected to be 54% in the EU (48% in all 33 EEA member countries) in 2020 ( EEA, 2015 ). The reduction is approximately 15% for the EU, as well as for all the 33 EEA member countries, between 2000 and 2020, which is below the 43% reduction milestone suggested by the air pollution thematic strategy for this period.   Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 1, the magnitude (though not the area) of the exceedance is projected to reduce considerably in most areas, except for a few hot spot areas, particularly in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in northern Italy. The risk of eutrophication increases slightly when only Natura 2000 protected areas are addressed ( EEA, 2014 ).   Figure 1.Exposure of ecosystems to eutrophication  area and magnitude of exceedance in 2000 and 2020              Source:  CCE (Coordination Centre for Effects), UNECE.      Note: The maps show areas where critical loads for eutrophication of freshwater and terrestrial habitats are exceeded    The main sources of eutrophication are emissions of nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere. Nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions for the EU decreased by approximately 43% between 2000 and 2014 ( EEA, 2016a ). This reduction has been primarily due to the introduction of three-way catalytic converters for cars. However, emission reductions from modern vehicles have not been as large as was originally anticipated. Standard diesel vehicles, for example, can emit up to seven times more NO x  in realworld conditions than in official tests ( EEA, 2016 b).   NH 3  emissions have not fallen by as much. In 2014, they had fallen by approximately 9% compared with their value in 2000 for the EU. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH 3  ( AIRS_PO3.2, 2016 ). 1 ; they amount to approximately 95% of total emissions in the EEA-33 region. Emissions primarily arise from the decomposition of urea in animal wastes and uric acid in poultry wastes.   A key driver behind the observed reductions was the implementation of the National Emission Ceilings Directive ( EU, 2001 ), which regulates, inter alia, emissions of the eutrophying air pollutants NO x  and NH 3 . However, eutrophying emissions not only from the agriculture and road transport sectors but also from shipping and air travel have been and will remain significant contributors to eutrophication caused by air pollution.   Further reductions in eutrophying air pollutant emissions are expected, inter alia, as a result of the 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol, which sets air pollutant emission ceilings for 2020 ( UNECE, 2012 ). Nevertheless, as illustrated by the results of the current legislation scenario (Figure 1), the decreases anticipated for 2020 are not expected to contribute sufficiently to reductions in the ecosystem area exposed to excess nitrogen deposition and affected by eutrophication. In 2020, more than 50% of the ecosystem areas are expected to be at risk of eutrophication in the EU.   The 2020 thematic strategy objective will therefore not be met unless additional measures to mitigate nitrogen emissions are introduced, through further specific and targeted (technical) measures, particularly in the agriculture and transport sectors. Dietary changes resulting in lessmeat and dairy farming andthe reduced use of petrol and diesel in cars could also contribute to reductions.   Country level information   Figure 2 shows the percentage of the area by country where the critical loads for eutrophication were exceeded in 2010 and the areas where exceedance is expected in 2020. Although a decrease is predicted by 2020, if current legislation is implemented, the area showing exceedance will be above 50% in most countries (see bars). Extremely high magnitudes of exceedance can be found in Denmark, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, caused by high deposition rates and/or ecosystems that are very sensitive to an excess supply of nitrogen from the atmosphere (see dots), for example nutrient-poor grasslands.     Figure 2.  The ecosystem area at risk of eutrophication and the magnitude of exceedance in each country          Note: AAE is the average accumulated exceedance, showing the magnitude of exceedance in equivalents (mol nitrogen/ha per year). The data are based on the revised Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction agreements of 2012 (assuming for the 2020 scenario that current legislation is fully implemented). Data for Serbia and Montenegro are presented as aggregated data.      Outlook beyond 2020   The updated air pollution strategy proposed by the European Commission in late 2013 aims to achieve a situation in which the EU ecosystem area exceeding critical loads for eutrophication is reduced by 35% by 2030, relative to 2005 ( EC, 2013 ). This target would not be met if only current legislation was fully implemented. In the EU, the area at risk of eutrophication is projected to decrease only slightly by 2030. The 35% reduction target would be met in 2030 if the maximum number of technically feasible reduction measures was implemented ( EEA, 2015 ).   As part of the air pollution strategy package, the European Commission has put forward a revised National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. This proposes more ambitious national commitments to reduce emissions, compared with the current Directive ( EC, 2001 ), for the two eutrophying air pollutants, NO x  and NH 3 , among other things. These new ceilings will be applicable from 2020 and 2030 and will contribute to the achievement of the objective of 35% by 2030.   Beyond 2030, a time horizon of 2050 has been proposed as an aspirational year in which to achieve Europes long-term objectives, i.e. that air pollution does not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment.   About the indicator   The indicator shows area and quantitative information for ecosystems where atmospheric nutrient nitrogen deposition is above the criticalload. A critical load is a quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or more pollutants, below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of the environment do not occur according to present knowledge (  UNECE, 2015  ).Deposition loads of eutrophying airborne pollutants above the critical loads are termed an 'exceedance'.   Exposure in an ecosystem for which information on critical loads is available, is calculated as the average accumulated exceedance (AAE). The AAE is the area-weighted average of exceedances, accumulated over all sensitive habitats (or ecosystem points) defined in a grid cell.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p><b>Indicator past trend </b></p> <p><b><strong><br /></strong></b></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p><b><span><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></span></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020 </b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Exposure of terrestrial ecosystems to eutrophication due to air pollution</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><strong>EU</strong></p> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><strong>EEA </strong></p> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> <p align='center'></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Reduce areas of critical load exceedance with<br />respect to eutrophication by 43 % from 2000 levels<br /> Air Pollution Thematic Strategy</p> </td> <td width='121'> <p></p> <p><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p>The area where ecosystems are exposed to eutrophication because of excess atmospheric nitrogen deposition has decreased.

Currently, the most important impact of air pollution on ecosystems and biodiversity is eutrophication caused by airborne nitrogen pollution.Excessive atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to ecosystems results in loss of sensitive species, increased growth of species that benefit from high nutrient levels, changes to habitat structure and function, the homogenisation of vegetation types, etc.</p> <h2><span>Policy targets and progress</span></h2> <p>The EU Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution includes an objective for 2020 of a 43% reduction in areas or ecosystems exposed to eutrophication, i.e. areas where eutrophication critical loads are exceeded <span>(</span><a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Al28159'>EC, 2005</a>a<span>)</span>.

This is in line with the long-term objective of not exceeding critical loads. </p> <p>In 2000, the area of ecosystems where the critical load was exceeded was almost 70% of the total in the EU Member States (approximately 60% in all 33 EEA member countries for which data were available, including the 28 EU Member States) and decreased in 2010 to 63% in the EU (55% in all 33 EEA member countries). Assuming that current legislation is fully implemented, the area in exceedance is projected to be 54% in the EU (48% in all 33 EEA member countries) in 2020 (<a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/exposure-of-ecosystems-to-acidification-3/assessment-1'>EEA, 2015</a>). The reduction is approximately 15% for the EU, as well as for all the 33 EEA member countries, between 2000 and 2020, which is below the 43% reduction milestone suggested by the air pollution thematic strategy for this period.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as illustrated in Figure 1, the magnitude (though not the area) of the exceedance is projected to reduce considerably in most areas, except for a few hot spot areas, particularly in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in northern Italy.

Nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions for the EU decreased by approximately 43% between 2000 and 2014 (<a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/main-anthropogenic-air-pollutant-emissions/assessment-1'>EEA, 2016a</a>). This reduction has been primarily due to the introduction of three-way catalytic converters for cars. However, emission reductions from modern vehicles have not been as large as was originally anticipated. Standard diesel vehicles, for example, can emit up to seven times more NO<sub>x</sub> in realworld conditions than in official tests (<a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/explaining-road-transport-emissions'>EEA, 2016</a>b).</p> <p>NH<sub>3 </sub>emissions have not fallen by as much. In 2014, they had fallen by approximately 9% compared with their value in 2000 for the EU. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH<sub>3 </sub>(<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/environment-and-health/air-pollutant-emissions' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO3.2, 2016</a>).<sup>1</sup>; they amount to approximately 95% of total emissions in the EEA-33 region. Emissions primarily arise from the decomposition of urea in animal wastes and uric acid in poultry wastes.</p> <p>A key driver behind the observed reductions was the implementation of the National Emission Ceilings Directive (<a href='http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/pollutants/ceilings.htm'>EU, 2001</a>), which regulates, inter alia, emissions of the eutrophying air pollutants NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>. However, eutrophying emissions not only from the agriculture and road transport sectors but also from shipping and air travel have been and will remain significant contributors to eutrophication caused by air pollution.</p> <p>Further reductions in eutrophying air pollutant emissions are expected, inter alia, as a result of the 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol, which sets air pollutant emission ceilings for 2020 (<a href='http://www.unece.org/env/lrtap/multi_h1.html'>UNECE, 2012</a>). Nevertheless, as illustrated by the results of the current legislation scenario (Figure 1), the decreases anticipated for 2020 are not expected to contribute sufficiently to reductions in the ecosystem area exposed to excess nitrogen deposition and affected by eutrophication. In 2020, more than 50% of the ecosystem areas are expected to be at risk of eutrophication in the EU.</p> <p>The 2020 thematic strategy objective will therefore not be met unless additional measures to mitigate nitrogen emissions are introduced, through further specific and targeted (technical) measures, particularly in the agriculture and transport sectors. Dietary changes resulting in lessmeat and dairy farming andthe reduced use of petrol and diesel in cars could also contribute to reductions.</p> <h2><b>Country level information</b></h2> <p>Figure 2 shows the percentage of the area by country where the critical loads for eutrophication were exceeded in 2010 and the areas where exceedance is expected in 2020. Although a decrease is predicted by 2020, if current legislation is implemented, the area showing exceedance will be above 50% in most countries (see bars). Extremely high magnitudes of exceedance can be found in Denmark, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, caused by high deposition rates and/or ecosystems that are very sensitive to an excess supply of nitrogen from the atmosphere (see dots), for example nutrient-poor grasslands.<span></span></p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 2. <span style='width: 0px; float: none; display: inline !important;'>The ecosystem area at risk of eutrophication and the magnitude of exceedance in each country</span></h4> <p><iframe height='678' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/the-ecosystem-area-at-risk/embed-chart?chart=chart_1&amp;chartWidth=615&amp;chartHeight=603&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7D.googlechart_filters%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D.googlechart-notes%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;skipdaviztitle=true&amp;skipcharttitle=true&amp;padding=12%2C59%2C213%2C60' width='615'></iframe></p> <p class='callout'><span class='discreet'><strong>Note:</strong> AAE is the average accumulated exceedance, showing the magnitude of exceedance in equivalents (mol nitrogen/ha per year).

This target would not be met if only current legislation was fully implemented. In the EU, the area at risk of eutrophication is projected to decrease only slightly by 2030. The 35% reduction target would be met in 2030 if the maximum number of technically feasible reduction measures was implemented (<a href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/exposure-of-ecosystems-to-acidification-3/assessment-1'>EEA, 2015</a>).</p> <p>As part of the air pollution strategy package, the European Commission has put forward a revised National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive. This proposes more ambitious national commitments to reduce emissions, compared with the current Directive (<a href='http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2001:309:0022:0030:EN:PDF'>EC, 2001</a>), for the two eutrophying air pollutants, NO<sub>x</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, among other things. These new ceilings will be applicable from 2020 and 2030 and will contribute to the achievement of the objective of 35% by 2030.</p> <p>Beyond 2030, a time horizon of 2050 has been proposed as an aspirational year in which to achieve Europes long-term objectives, i.e. that air pollution does not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment.</p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>The indicator shows area and quantitative information for ecosystems where atmospheric nutrient nitrogen deposition is above the criticalload.

Climate change impacts can be seen in global sea level rise, changes in precipitation (e.g. increases in northern and north-western Europe and decreases in southern Europe), decreasing snow cover, glaciers, sea ice and ice sheets. These changes lead to a wide range of often adverse impacts on environmental systems, economic sectors, and human health and well-being in Europe (EEA, 2012 and 2016; IPCC, 2014). Climate change adaptation addresses the adverse effects of climate change and builds resilience to reduce vulnerabilities and risks to the environment, human health and the economy (including infrastructure).   Policy targets and progress   The European Commissions White Paper (EC, 2009) and EU strategy on adaptation to climate change (EC, 2013) encourage all Member States to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. The strategy promotes action in cities and the mainstreaming of adaptation in relevant EU policies and programmes. In addition, it provides funding for actions, enhances research under the Horizon 2020 programme for environment and climate action, and promotes information sharing through the European Climate Adaptation Platform. In 2017, the European Commission will assess whether or not the action being taken in the Member States is sufficient. If it deems progress to be insufficient, by reference to the coverage and quality of the national strategies, the Commission will consider proposing a legally binding instrument (EC, 2013). That 2017 report will include an adaptation preparedness scoreboard, with key process-based indicators for measuring Member States levels of readiness.   NASs usually address overarching issues that allow them to position adaptation on the policy agenda. These strategies recognise the importance of expected climate change impacts and the need to adapt, and they facilitate the process of coordinating the adaptation response, increasing awareness of adaptation and stakeholder involvement, assessing risks and vulnerabilities, and identifying knowledge gaps.   NAPs usually aim to implement NASs and to organise activities for achieving their objectives, typically through sectoral implementation. Although adaptation implementation at national level is still at an early stage, adaptation planning work is under way in most countries.    Country level information    Table 1 provides an overview of progress with the adoption of national and sectoral climate change adaptation strategies and plans by EEA member countries. To date, 20 EU Member States and three other EEA member countries have adopted NASs. In addition, nine EU Member States and three other EEA member countries have developed NAPs. Table 1 shows that over the last 5 years there has been a steady increase in the number of NASs and NAPs being adopted by EU Member States and other EEA member countries, and this is expected to continue towards 2020, with additional countries adopting strategies and plans as well as implementing more specific adaptation policies and actions in line with their strategies and plans.      Table 1.  Overview of national and sectoral climate change adaptation strategies and plans, by country             Source: EEA, 2014, information reported by EU Member States under the European mechanism for monitoring and reporting information relevant to climate change (Regulation (EU) No 525/2013) and for other EEA Member countries information provided on a voluntary basis to the EEA as of May 2016.    Regarding the implementing of adaptation policies and actions, most progress has been reported for freshwater management, flood risk management, agriculture and forestry. The adaptation actions in these sectors have mostly consisted of mainstreaming adaptation priorities into these national sectoral policy areas. Several countries have also developed national health strategies and action plans, including early warning systems for heatwaves and enhanced surveillance of infectious diseases (EEA, 2014).   A limited number of countries have started to monitor and report on adaptation policies and actions at national level (EEA, 2014). So far, even fewer countries evaluate adaptation policies at national level; there are various reasons, including the fact that implementation of adaptation has only just begun (EEA, 2015). The countries that monitor these use mainly process-based methods, assessing to what extent agreed stages in the process of taking actions have taken place. Very few countries use outcome-based approaches, assessing if and how vulnerability has decreased and/or resilience has increased, because this is methodologically very complex and also resource intensive. It will therefore not be possible to determine with any certainty whether or not decisive progress in adapting to the impact of climate change can be achieved by 2020.   Transnational cooperation in adaptation to climate change has increased with the recognition of the importance of adaptation as a cross-cutting policy area. Adaptation actions take place, for example, within the EU Baltic Sea region strategy, the Danube Commission and the Carpathian and Alpine conventions. Adaptation action is often linked to the sharing of natural resources such as transboundary water catchments (EEA, 2016).   Adaptation policy will receive new EU financial resources in the coming years. Of the EU budget for 20142020, 20% will be used for climate-related actions (i.e. adaptation and climate change mitigation).   Outlook beyond 2020   Because of expected future climate change impacts, efforts to adapt to climate change and to make Europe more climate resilient need to be strengthened in future. NASs and NAPs, together with the EUs 2013 adaptation strategy, are expected to be further implemented, and mainstreaming of climate change adaptation in policies is expected to continue. Key global agreements that can also enhance action on adaptation in Europe include the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015), which requires countries to take adaptation action, complementary to climate change mitigation action, and the 2015 UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2015), which acknowledges climate change as one of the drivers of disaster risk and requires countries to take risk prevention and reduction measures.     About the indicator   This indicator shows the number of Member States that have adopted an adaptation strategy and/or plan and indicates how many countries have made progress on adapting to climate change by setting this issue on the policy agenda (through strategies). Many of these action plans have been in place for only a few years (see Table 1), so implementation has started rather recently. There is limited quantitative information available, and in only a few countries, on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and plans regarding enhanced resilience and reduced vulnerabilities and risks. This indicator is therefore not yet able to show the effectiveness of these strategies and plans in making Europe more climate resilient. More information on this is expected to become available in future when more countries implement monitoring, reporting and evaluation adaptation schemes.,<table class='plain' style='width: 1000px;'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>EU indicator past trend</strong> <br /><br /></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by2020</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020 <br /></b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Number of countries that have adopted a climate change adaptation strategy and/or plan</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'>N.A.<sup><a class='external-link' href='#note1' target='_self' title=''>(1)</a></sup></p> </td> <td> <p align='center'>Make decisive progress in adapting to the impact of climate change  7th EAP</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/da466c84-2e67-4e97-83a1-3a87190ae755.jpeg' alt='Stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow circle: it is uncertain whether or not the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='900'> <p>There has been an increase in the number of countries that have adopted a national adaptation strategy and/or plan and this is expected to continue.

Key global agreements that can also enhance action on adaptation in Europe include the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015), which requires countries to take adaptation action, complementary to climate change mitigation action, and the 2015 UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2015), which acknowledges climate change as one of the drivers of disaster risk and requires countries to take risk prevention and reduction measures.<span></span></p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>This indicator shows the number of Member States that have adopted an adaptation strategy and/or plan and indicates how many countries have made progress on adapting to climate change by setting this issue on the policy agenda (through strategies). Many of these action plans have been in place for only a few years (see Table 1), so implementation has started rather recently. There is limited quantitative information available, and in only a few countries, on the effectiveness of adaptation strategies and plans regarding enhanced resilience and reduced vulnerabilities and risks. This indicator is therefore not yet able to show the effectiveness of these strategies and plans in making Europe more climate resilient. More information on this is expected to become available in future when more countries implement monitoring, reporting and evaluation adaptation schemes.</p>","Number of countries that have adopted a climate change adaptation strategy/plan",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) calls for decisive progress to be made in adapting to the impact of climate change.

Adaptation of Europes society to climate change is necessary to address the adverse impacts of climate change and complement efforts to mitigate climate change. Action to mitigate climate change and adapt to it will increase the resilience of the EUs economy and society, while stimulating innovation and protecting the EUs natural resources. To date, 20 EU Member States have adopted a national adaptation strategy (NAS) and nine have developed a national adaptation plan (NAP). There has been an increase in the number of countries that have adopted national adaptation strategies and/or plans and this is expected to continue and to deepen, with additional countries adopting follow-up adaptation policies and implementation plans. However, information on the progress of these policies in reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience is limited, so the outlook towards 2020 for this 7th EAP objective remains uncertain.</p>","2016-12-09T09:00:00Z","2017-02-27T11:17:34Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Czech Republic,Austria,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Netherlands,Greece,Germany,Belgium,Lithuania,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",,"published","Climate change adaptation","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/environment-and-health/climate-change-adaptation-strategies","Briefing (all)","2003,2014,2004,2015,2016,2005,2006,2017,2007,2018,2008,2019,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2001,2012,2002,2013","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

If the current pace of growth is maintained, the 2020 renewable energy target will be met             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the scene   The 7th EAP supports the EUs objective of meeting its 2020 renewable energy target, as stipulated in the Renewable Energy Directive (EU, 2013). In comparison with fossil fuels, using renewable energy results in reduced greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, reduced environmental and health impacts, and a reduced dependency on energy imports.   Policy targets and progress   The Renewable Energy Directive (EU, 2009) commits the EU to reaching 20% of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020. It sets binding national targets for renewable energy consumption in 2020 and it prescribes for each Member State minimum indicative trajectories in the run-up to 2020 to ensure that national targets will be met.   The Directive also requires Member States to adopt national renewable energy action plans that outline expected trajectories for the national share of renewable energy sources (RES) from 2010 to 2020. It also requires Member States to report every 2 years on progress towards the indicative trajectories of the Directive as well as towards the trajectories that they have set themselves in their action plans.   Figure 1. Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, EU-28        Note:    Share results 2014       As can be seen in Figure 1, the proportion of renewable energy increased continuously between 2005 and 2014, with an annual compound growth rate of 7%, to reach 15% in 2013 and 16% in 2014 (EEA, 2015a). This has put the EU well on the path to meeting its target. The increase has been more rapid than the target path. The increase was mainly the result of various support schemes that were put in place by Member States, such as feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums, auction/tender systems, quotas, tax credits and grants.   Shrinking production costs due to the scaling up of global production volumes and technological advances have also played an important role (EC, 2015). Photovoltaics (technologies that transform solar energy to electricity) have experienced the largest reduction in costs, with costs per kilowatt hour decreasing by 53% between 2010 and 2014 (UNEP, 2014). Electricity from onshore wind turbines became 15% cheaper during the same period (UNEP, 2014). Lower final energy consumption has also helped the EU to increase its renewable energy share (see EEA, 2016, and the EEAs final energy consumption indicator, CSI027) because, if final energy consumption is lower, a lower overall quantity of energy is required from renewables to meet the target.   If Member States fully deliver on their national renewable energy action plans, the EU will slightly over-achieve its target (by about 1percentage point) (EEA, 2015b). Wind power, solar electricity and biofuels for transport are expected to have the highest growth rates to 2020 (UNEP, 2014). This was also the case during the 20052014 period, in particular with respect to wind and solar electricity. In absolute terms, however, hydropower and biomass (for heat generation) will remain the most important single RES, despite a decrease in their contribution to the overall energy produced by renewable sources. In 2012, hydropower accounted for 17%, and biomass and waste for 64%, of final renewable energy consumption.    While EU countries still lead the world in total installed renewable capacity, the EU is losing ground to China, Japan and the United States with respect to new installations (EEA, 2016). The EU was the region with the highest RES investments every single year from 2005 to 2012, surpassed by China only in 2013 (UNEP, 2014); this shows that the EU played a leading role in the development of renewables in their early stage, and for the global roll-out of RES. Of world regions with sufficient data availability, the EU came third in per capita employment in the area of renewable energy in 2014 (EEA, 2016). However, in 2013, EU investment in renewables slumped by 44% compared with the previous year. This reflected not only lower costs but also uncertainty about the future of support mechanisms and lower investment capacity due to the persistent economic downturn in some EU countries (UNEP, 2014). Feed-in tariffs, an effective renewable energy support scheme, were drastically cut in 2012 and 2013 in some Member States. In some cases these changes were applied retroactively, i.e. to existing plants (EC, 2015). Policy uncertainty increases the costs of renewable energy installation and makes Europe a less attractive prospect for investors and renewable energy developers (UNEP, 2014). This has already been observed in the solar power industry. The strong growth in the renewable energy sector in Europe is picked up in the Environmental goods and services sector briefing ( AIRS_PO2.12 )  1   and the Environmental protection expenditure briefing ( AIRS_ PO2.13 ).  2    Given this context, further action from Member States may be required to ensure that the EU remains on the path to the 2020 target. A number of European governments have introduced measures such as premiums on spot market prices, competitive tenders or capacity-dependent feed-in tariffs to help protect and increase the market penetration of renewable energy operators (EC, 2015a). In 2014, the European Commission published guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy for the period up until 2020 (EC, 2014), which, inter alia, should contribute towards a more harmonised approach to supporting renewable energy growth across the EU.    Country level information     Figure 2. Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption           As can be seen in Figure 2, the contribution of RES to gross final energy consumption varies greatly between countries in Europe. This reflects different starting points in the deployment of renewables in each country and differences in the availability of natural resources to produce renewable energy. It also reflects, to some extent, differences in policies to stimulate renewables. Between 2004 and 2014, 12 EU countries at least doubled their renewable energy shares and Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, Romania and Sweden have already reached their targets for 2020.    The countries that are the furthest from their targets are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France (EEA, 2015b). As they account for about one third of the EUs final energy consumption, their progress in the deployment of renewable energy will play an important role in the prospects of the EU meeting its overall target.    Outlook beyond 2020    Additional deployment of RES beyond 2020 is vital if the EU is to achieve its aim of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels  an aim that is key to the 7th EAPs long-term vision of low-carbon growth decoupled from resource use well before 2050. EU countries have already agreed on a new, EU-wide renewable energy target of at least 27% of gross final energy consumption by 2030. The continued effort to expand renewable energy in the EU will also be a key element of the Energy Union strategy (EC, 2015b), which aims to ensure secure, sustainable and affordable energy supply for all EU citizens. Challenges for further progress in renewable energy are the expansion of the grid infrastructure to include a growing share of often decentralised RES, the increase of flexibility options in the system to accommodate a growing share of intermittent renewable technologies (e.g. through the development of demand-side management and energy storage options), and the sustainable sourcing and use of biomass (including biofuels).   About the indicator   This indicator is defined as the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption. Gross final energy consumption is defined as energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to industry, transport, households, services including public services, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, including the consumption of electricity and heat by the energy branch for electricity and heat production and including losses of electricity and heat in distribution and transmission (EU, 2009). The indicator includes the contribution of renewable sources to all of the final uses of energy (electricity, transport, and heating and cooling). RES include wind, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydro, ocean energy sources, biomass and the biodegradable fraction of waste.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption</p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '> <img alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /> </span></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p align='center'>Reach a 20% share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption - Renewable Energy Directive</p> </td> <td width='121'><img alt='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' /></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p>The EU has steadily increased the share of renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption.

The EU is losing biodiversity. Biodiversity is not only important in its own right, it also provides society with a wide range of ecosystem services upon which we depend, such as food, freshwater, pollination etc. This briefing examines trends in populations of common farmland and forest birds, and grassland butterflies. These are considered by the scientific community to be excellent barometers of the overall biodiversity and of the health of ecosystems, as they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change. For aspects of legally protected biodiversity and habitats, see the briefings on EU protected species ( AIRS_PO1.7, 2016 ) 1  and habitats ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ). 2    Policy targets and progress   Halting and reversing the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 is the central aim of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (EC, 2011). This includes preserving common biodiversity such as commonbirds and grassland butterflies. This aligns with the 7th EAP objective of halting, by 2020, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services.   Since 1990, common bird populations have decreased by around 15% in the EU; the decline of common farmland birds was more pronounced at34%, whereas common forest birds declined by13%. The trends remain very similar when Norway and Switzerland, two other EEA member countries for which data are available, are also included in the indicator coverage; for more information see the EEAindicator: abundance and distribution ofselected species(EEA, 2016).   Figure 1. Long term trends for common bird species in 23 EU countries*          Note: * 23 EU Member States = all EU Member States except Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania.    The negative trend in farmland-related biodiversity is confirmed by the population index forgrassland butterflies in Figure 2 (species with a high sensitivity to habitat degradation and loss), for which a significant decline of 30% has been observed since 1990.        Figure 2. Long term trends for grassland butterflies in 14 EU countries         The long-term trends for common farmland birds and forest birds, as well as grassland butterflies, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, demonstrate that the EU has experienced a major decline in biodiversity associated with agro-ecosystems and grasslands (EEA, 2015). This was primarily due to habitat change  including loss, fragmentation and degradation  of natural and semi-natural habitats. The habitat change was mainly caused by homogenisation and loss of habitat as a result of agricultural intensification and land abandonment, intensely managed forests and some loss of habitats to urbanisation (EEA, 2015).   This negative trend shows no sign of changing, despite progress in enacting and implementing European policies (such the Birds and Habitats Directives (EU, 1992 and 2009) and the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000)), as well as the environmental measures within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Unfortunately, to date the CAP has not influenced agricultural practices enough to reduce overall loss of biodiversity. The outcomes of the latest Habitats Directive reporting round demonstrate the lack of any substantial progress in the conservation status of grasslands. The vast majority of assessments of the conservation status of agricultural habitats, as well as of woodland and other forest habitats, remain unfavourable (over 86 % and 80 %, respectively).   The environment-related elements set out in the EU reform package, in particular for EU agriculture and cohesion policies, backed by the initiatives for greening the EU budget under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 20142020, are designed to support those objectives. Greening of the CAP aims to promote environmentally beneficial agricultural and forestry practices such as crop diversification, the protection of permanent grassland and grazing land, and sustainable agroforestry. Rural Development Programmes 20142020 address restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems through payments to cover the cost of farmers adopting environment- and climate-friendly land management practices.   The mid-term review of the EU Biodiversity Strategy comprehensively assessed progress towards the headline target (and towards all six targets) and concluded that the EU is not on track to meet the objective of halting biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystem services by 2020 (EC, 2015). The continuing declining trends apparent for regularly monitored groups, such as grassland butterflies and farmland birds, despite environmental measures implemented so far, illustrate well that it is highly unlikely that the objective will be achieved by 2020.   Outlook beyond 2020   It is difficult to forecast how soon biodiversity, as illustrated by the abundance of bird and grassland butterfly populations, will recover, as their state is influenced by a complex combination of environmental factors and policy measures.Substantialpositive impacts of the CAP reform and the measures anticipated under the Multi-Annual Financial Framework 20142020 on common species associated with farmland might become visible in the 20202030 period, as long as these policies are implemented thoroughly and on a large scale throughout the EU.On the other hand, other factors that could adversely impact the outlook beyond 2020 include the negative impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems, particularly on these specialist species groups that are dependent on non-intensive agriculture and forest ecosystems. The increased competition for land could also intensify agricultural production in the EU, through land take via urbanisation ( AIRS_PO1.3, 2016 ) 3 , as well as for the production of renewable energy and biofuels ( AIRS_PO2.6, 2016 ) 4 .   About the indicator   This indicator shows trends in the abundance of common birds and grassland butterflies over time across their European distribution. It is an index indicator (relative values, 1990 set to 100). Birds and butterflies are excellent barometers of the overall health of ecosystems, mainly because they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change. The data collection methods are scientifically sound, and birds and butterflies are familiar groups of species well known to the public. Common birds are monitored in 25 European countries (23 EUMember States(all EU-28,except Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta and Romania) plus Norway and Switzerland). Butterfly monitoring has a more limited geographical coverage, with data available from 14 EU countries (Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom).,<table class='plain' style='width: 712px;'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p><b><span><strong>Indicator past trend<br /></strong></span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Indicative outlook</strong><br /><strong>of the EU meeting</strong><br /><strong>the selected</strong><br /><strong>objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Abundance and distribution of selected species (common birds and grassland butterflies)</p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '><span><strong>EU</strong></span></p> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '><span><br /></span></p> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '><span>Birds </span></p> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '><span><span><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-triangle-deteriorating-trend/@@images/7f0c4bbe-354c-4a58-942a-26561fbaebd4.jpeg' alt='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' class='image-inline' title='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' /></span></span></p> <p align='center'><span><span><span>Butterflies <span><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-triangle-deteriorating-trend/@@images/7f0c4bbe-354c-4a58-942a-26561fbaebd4.jpeg' alt='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' class='image-inline' title='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' /></span><br /></span></span></span></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '><strong>EEA </strong></p> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '></p> <p align='center' style='margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: center; '><span>Birds <img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-triangle-deteriorating-trend/@@images/7f0c4bbe-354c-4a58-942a-26561fbaebd4.jpeg' alt='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' class='image-inline' title='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' /><br /></span></p> <p align='center'></p> <p align='center'></p> <p align='center'><span><span><span><br /></span></span></span></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Meet the headline target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy: to halt the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services</p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '></p> <p style='text-align: center; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p>It is highly unlikely that the objective will be achieved by 2020 given the continuing declining trends apparent for certain groups, such as grassland butterflies and farmland birds</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <div class='pageBreak'></div> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) contains the objective of halting, by 2020, the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services, as well as restoring them as far as feasible.

Biodiversity is not only important in its own right, it also provides society with a wide range of ecosystem services upon which we depend, such as food, freshwater, pollination etc. This briefing examines trends in populations of common farmland and forest birds, and grassland butterflies. These are considered by the scientific community to be excellent barometers of the overall biodiversity and of the health of ecosystems, as they occur in many habitats and are sensitive to environmental change.

This was primarily due to habitat change  including loss, fragmentation and degradation  of natural and semi-natural habitats. The habitat change was mainly caused by homogenisation and loss of habitat as a result of agricultural intensification and land abandonment, intensely managed forests and some loss of habitats to urbanisation (EEA, 2015).</p> <p>This negative trend shows no sign of changing, despite progress in enacting and implementing European policies (such the Birds and Habitats Directives (EU, 1992 and 2009) and the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000)), as well as the environmental measures within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Unfortunately, to date the CAP has not influenced agricultural practices enough to reduce overall loss of biodiversity.

The waste hierarchy is the central framework for EU and national waste policies. This hierarchy gives the highest priority to policies and actions that promote waste prevention, followed by preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery and finally disposal. This briefing presents trends in waste generation. Reducing the amount of waste generated means that there is less waste to manage and also potentially that the demand for material resources and associated environmental impacts has been reduced ( AIRS_PO2.1, 2016 ). 1     Policy targets and progress    The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe includes the goal that, by 2020, waste generated per capita will be in absolutedecline (EC, 2011).Waste prevention and the use of waste as a resource is becoming increasingly important, not only in environmental policy but also in industrial and raw material policy. In December 2015, the European Commissionpublished Closing the loop  An EU action plan for thecircular economy (EC, 2015), otherwise known as the Circular Economy Package. Unlikethe traditional linear takemakeconsumedispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respectplanetary boundaries by increasing the proportion of renewable or recyclable resources while reducingthe consumption of raw materials.   Approaches such as eco-design and sharing, reuse, repair and refurbishing will play a significant role in maintaining the utility of products and components, and reducing the generation of waste (EEA, 2016).   The Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008), obliges EU Member States to adopt and implement waste prevention programmes. A review of available programmes indicates that countries use a broad range of measures with a focus on information-based instruments. However, not all programmes include quantified waste prevention targets or economic instruments (EEA, 2015).    Figure 1. Generation of waste, excluding major mineral wastes,  EU            The total amount of waste in the EU, excluding major mineral wastes, reduced by 2% between 2004 and 2012 (Figure 1). In 2012, the highest levels of waste generation were recorded for households, the water and waste sector and the manufacturing sector.   Trends in individual sectors have been mixed. Between 2004 and 2012, there was a reduction in the waste generated by agriculture, forestry and fishing (37%), manufacturing (26%), and services (19%). Household waste generation declined by a more modest 5% over the same period.   Waste generated by the water and waste sector and the construction industry grew at a rapid pace: by 61% and 45%, respectively, despite a dip in construction waste output in 2008 that corresponded with the economic downturn. However, waste generated by the waste sector includes secondary waste so it is likely that an increase in recycling activities has contributed to this increase,becausesome material that is collected for recyclingcannot be recovered and has to re-join the waste stream. This effect cannot currently be quantified because of a lack of data.   Figure 2 presents indices for the waste generated by the two main production sectors of the European economy (manufacturing and services), for the EU-28 plus Norway, and by household consumption for the EEA-33 (EU-28, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey). Household waste comprises the bulk of municipal waste. The figure also shows a measure of the economic output of services and manufacturing(the gross value added)and a measure of consumption (household expenditure).   Figure 2. Waste generation by production and consumption activities        Some economic production and consumption activities in Europe are becoming less waste intensive, even if allowance is made for the 2008 economic downturn. Figure 2 shows that waste generation from manufacturing declined by 25% in absolute terms between 2004 and 2012, despite an increase of 7% in sectoral economic output. Waste generation from the service sector also declined by 23% in the same period, despite an increase of 13% in sectoral economic output.   Turning to consumption, total municipal waste generation in the EEA-33 declined by 2% between 2004 and 2012, despite a 7% increase in real household expenditure. Per capita generation of municipal waste (EEA-33), which mostly originates from households, declined by 5% in the same period, falling from 511 to 485kg per capita.   The overall improvements are most likely due to a combination of various factors: efficiency improvements in production processes and management, changes in the structure of the manufacturing sector, an increase in activity in the services sector and a shift towards less intensive waste-generating activities. However, some of the trends might be influenced by data quality issues. For example, the distinction between waste and by-products has a significant impact on the amounts of waste generated in agriculture, forestry and fishing; and in manufacturing (EC, 2014).   The services sector is an order of magnitude less waste intensive than the manufacturing sector: 0.014kg/EUR in 2012 for services and 0.12kg/EUR in 2012 for manufacturing. An economic restructuring towards more service industries can therefore be a key driver towards reduced waste generation.   The structure of production in Europe is changing. Trade liberalisation combined with lower labour costs and less regulation in many developing countries has resulted in the movement of the production of goods consumed in Europe to other regions of the world. Some sectors, including the metals, telecommunications, electrical appliances, textiles, food and chemical sectors, have been particularly affected by relocation since 2000. Some parts of the services sector have also been affected. This development may have added to the decline in waste generation (EEA, 2014).   The overall amount of waste generated has remained fairly stable, with only a slight reduction between 2004 and 2012. While some sectors are becoming less waste intensive, the prospect that total waste generation will be in decline by 2020 is uncertain. Total waste generation began to rise again between 2010 and 2012 as economies recovered. However, theCircular Economy Package and the waste prevention programmes in the EU Member States should contribute to a reduction in waste generation.      Country level information    Figure 3. Waste (excluding mineral and solidified) generation by country, 2004 and 2012 (kg/capita)         Figure 3 shows that the majority of European countries generate between 1 and 2 tonnes of waste (excluding mineral waste) per person per year. That figure is declining in most countries; however, increases in some countries may be due to changes in data collection methods. This is the case in Belgium (EC, 2014), and the high figures for Estonia are believed to relate to the inclusion of waste from the oil shale industry, which is included as mineral wastes in other countries (Eurostat, 2014).    Outlook beyond 2020    The long-term prospects for reducing the waste generated by production activities appear positive, although some of these gains could be associated with the movement of manufacturing industries out of Europe. A shift to a circular economy, with increased reuse of goods and materials, will reduce both consumption- andproduction-based waste generation. The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015) includes a number of measures that aim to reduce waste generation beyond 2020. These include concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis  turning one industrys by-product into another industrys raw material  and economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electric and electronic equipment, vehicles). The success of these measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for reducing waste generation.   About the indicator   This indicator is defined as the weight of waste generated by an economy per year, excluding mineral wastes, dredging spoils and contaminated soils. This exclusion enhances comparability across countries, as mineral waste accounts for very high quantities in some countries and for some economic activities, such as mining and construction. If this category were included, it would account for 71% of the total waste generated in the EU in 2012.   Waste generation data are published by Eurostat every 2 years for seven broad economic sectors: agriculture, forestry and fishing; energy and extraction; water and waste; manufacturing; construction; services; and households.   The water and waste sector includes water collection, treatment and supply, sewerage and three waste sector categories (waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery, remediation activities and other waste management services; and wholesale of waste and scrap). The three waste sectors include secondary waste, i.e. material that has originated from other sectors.   The energy and extraction sector includes electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply plus non-mineral wastes from mining and quarrying. Manufacturing includes foods, textiles, wood, paper, coke, chemicals, metals, electronics, transport equipment and other machinery.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p style='text-align: left; '><b>Indicator past trend</b></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p style='text-align: left; '></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Waste generation in Europe<em><br /></em></p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; '> <p><strong>EU</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/c0deea0d-40aa-4102-8916-867cdd2d7dde.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></p> <p></p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; '> <p><strong>EEA</strong></p> <p><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/c0deea0d-40aa-4102-8916-867cdd2d7dde.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></p> </td> <td> <p><span>Manage waste safely as a resource.

Unlikethe traditional linear takemakeconsumedispose approach, a circular economy seeks to respectplanetary boundaries by increasing the proportion of renewable or recyclable resources while reducingthe consumption of raw materials.</p> <p>Approaches such as eco-design and sharing, reuse, repair and refurbishing will play a significant role in maintaining the utility of products and components, and reducing the generation of waste (EEA, 2016).</p> <p>The Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008), obliges EU Member States to adopt and implement waste prevention programmes. A review of available programmes indicates that countries use a broad range of measures with a focus on information-based instruments. However, not all programmes include quantified waste prevention targets or economic instruments (EEA, 2015).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Figure 1.

In 2012, the highest levels of waste generation were recorded for households, the water and waste sector and the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>Trends in individual sectors have been mixed. Between 2004 and 2012, there was a reduction in the waste generated by agriculture, forestry and fishing (37%), manufacturing (26%), and services (19%). Household waste generation declined by a more modest 5% over the same period.</p> <p>Waste generated by the water and waste sector and the construction industry grew at a rapid pace: by 61% and 45%, respectively, despite a dip in construction waste output in 2008 that corresponded with the economic downturn. However, waste generated by the waste sector includes secondary waste so it is likely that an increase in recycling activities has contributed to this increase,becausesome material that is collected for recyclingcannot be recovered and has to re-join the waste stream. This effect cannot currently be quantified because of a lack of data.</p> <p>Figure 2 presents indices for the waste generated by the two main production sectors of the European economy (manufacturing and services), for the EU-28 plus Norway, and by household consumption for the EEA-33 (EU-28, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey). Household waste comprises the bulk of municipal waste. The figure also shows a measure of the economic output of services and manufacturing(the gross value added)and a measure of consumption (household expenditure).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 2. Waste generation by production and consumption activities</h4> <p><iframe height='452' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/waste-generation-by-production-and-1/embed-chart?chart=chart_1&amp;chartWidth=600&amp;chartHeight=338&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7Ddiv%5Bid*%3D%22googlechart_wm_%22%5D%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;padding=5%2C157%2C53%2C70' width='600'></iframe></p> <p>Some economic production and consumption activities in Europe are becoming less waste intensive, even if allowance is made for the 2008 economic downturn. Figure 2 shows that waste generation from manufacturing declined by 25% in absolute terms between 2004 and 2012, despite an increase of 7% in sectoral economic output. Waste generation from the service sector also declined by 23% in the same period, despite an increase of 13% in sectoral economic output.</p> <p>Turning to consumption, total municipal waste generation in the EEA-33 declined by 2% between 2004 and 2012, despite a 7% increase in real household expenditure. Per capita generation of municipal waste (EEA-33), which mostly originates from households, declined by 5% in the same period, falling from 511 to 485kg per capita.</p> <p>The overall improvements are most likely due to a combination of various factors: efficiency improvements in production processes and management, changes in the structure of the manufacturing sector, an increase in activity in the services sector and a shift towards less intensive waste-generating activities. However, some of the trends might be influenced by data quality issues. For example, the distinction between waste and by-products has a significant impact on the amounts of waste generated in agriculture, forestry and fishing; and in manufacturing (EC, 2014).</p> <p>The services sector is an order of magnitude less waste intensive than the manufacturing sector: 0.014kg/EUR in 2012 for services and 0.12kg/EUR in 2012 for manufacturing. An economic restructuring towards more service industries can therefore be a key driver towards reduced waste generation.</p> <p>The structure of production in Europe is changing. Trade liberalisation combined with lower labour costs and less regulation in many developing countries has resulted in the movement of the production of goods consumed in Europe to other regions of the world. Some sectors, including the metals, telecommunications, electrical appliances, textiles, food and chemical sectors, have been particularly affected by relocation since 2000. Some parts of the services sector have also been affected. This development may have added to the decline in waste generation (EEA, 2014).</p> <p>The overall amount of waste generated has remained fairly stable, with only a slight reduction between 2004 and 2012. While some sectors are becoming less waste intensive, the prospect that total waste generation will be in decline by 2020 is uncertain. Total waste generation began to rise again between 2010 and 2012 as economies recovered. However, theCircular Economy Package and the waste prevention programmes in the EU Member States should contribute to a reduction in waste generation.</p> <div class='pageBreak'></div> <h2>Country level information</h2> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Figure 3. Waste (excluding mineral and solidified) generation by country, 2004 and 2012 (kg/capita)</span></h4> <p><iframe height='722' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/waste-generation-per-capita/embed-chart?chart=googlechartid_chart_12&amp;chartWidth=578&amp;chartHeight=660&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7D.googlechart_filters%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7Ddiv%5Bid*%3D%22googlechart_wm_%22%5D%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;padding=11%2C14%2C69%2C227' width='590'></iframe></p> <p>Figure 3 shows that the majority of European countries generate between 1 and 2 tonnes of waste (excluding mineral waste) per person per year. That figure is declining in most countries; however, increases in some countries may be due to changes in data collection methods. This is the case in Belgium (EC, 2014), and the high figures for Estonia are believed to relate to the inclusion of waste from the oil shale industry, which is included as mineral wastes in other countries (Eurostat, 2014).</p> <h2><span>Outlook beyond 2020</span></h2> <p>The long-term prospects for reducing the waste generated by production activities appear positive, although some of these gains could be associated with the movement of manufacturing industries out of Europe. A shift to a circular economy, with increased reuse of goods and materials, will reduce both consumption- andproduction-based waste generation. The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015) includes a number of measures that aim to reduce waste generation beyond 2020. These include concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis  turning one industrys by-product into another industrys raw material  and economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electric and electronic equipment, vehicles). The success of these measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for reducing waste generation.</p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>This indicator is defined as the weight of waste generated by an economy per year, excluding mineral wastes, dredging spoils and contaminated soils. This exclusion enhances comparability across countries, as mineral waste accounts for very high quantities in some countries and for some economic activities, such as mining and construction. If this category were included, it would account for 71% of the total waste generated in the EU in 2012.</p> <p>Waste generation data are published by Eurostat every 2 years for seven broad economic sectors: agriculture, forestry and fishing; energy and extraction; water and waste; manufacturing; construction; services; and households.</p> <p>The water and waste sector includes water collection, treatment and supply, sewerage and three waste sector categories (waste collection, treatment and disposal activities; materials recovery, remediation activities and other waste management services; and wholesale of waste and scrap). The three waste sectors include secondary waste, i.e. material that has originated from other sectors.</p> <p>The energy and extraction sector includes electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply plus non-mineral wastes from mining and quarrying. Manufacturing includes foods, textiles, wood, paper, coke, chemicals, metals, electronics, transport equipment and other machinery.</p>","Waste generation",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) states that, by 2020, absolute and per capita waste generation should be in decline. A society that meets its needs while producing less waste is more resource efficient with lower environmental risks from waste management. The total amount of waste, excluding major mineral wastes, generated in Europe remained stable (only a 2% reduction) between 2004 and 2012, with an increase between 2010 and 2012. Waste generation by the manufacturing, mining and quarrying, agriculture, forestry and fishing, and service industries has significantly reduced. Waste from households has also reduced, though more modestly. However, waste from the construction and the water and waste sectors has increased sharply.The reduction in waste from manufacturing is likely to be due to a combination of improvements in the efficiency of production processes and a shift towards less-intensive waste-generating activities as more intensive manufacturing industries move production out of Europe. In addition, the shift from manufacturing industries to service industries might also have had an effect on waste generation. However, statistical changes in the allocation of waste to the economic sectors and re-classification of waste to by-products might have contributed to the trends as well. This mixed picture suggests that the outlook to 2020 is unclear. The measures in the Circular Economy Package aim to reduce waste generation in the longer term.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-27T11:21:47Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Czech Republic,Cyprus,Austria,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Greece,Netherlands,Germany,Belgium,Lithuania,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",,"published","Resource efficiency and waste","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/waste-generation","Briefing (all)","2003,2014,2015,2004,2005,2016,2006,2017,2007,2018,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2001,2012,2002,2013","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

It also harms crop growth and ecosystems, and damages the built environment (EEA, 2016a). In Europe, the most problematic pollutants in terms of harm to human health are particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone (O 3 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). PM is emitted directly from emission sources but also can form in the atmosphere from various precursor pollutants including sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and ammonia (NH 3 ). Ground-level O 3  is similarly formed in the atmosphere from various precursor species including NO x  and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). Each of these pollutants can contribute to premature mortality and morbidity including respiratory illness and cardiovascular disease. SO 2 , NO x  and NH 3  also cause ecosystem acidification and eutrophication, as well as damage to buildings and vegetation. When absorbed by plants, O 3  damages plant cells, impairing their ability to grow and reproduce, and leading to reduced agricultural crop yields, decreased forest growth and reduced biodiversity. The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) sets out commitments to improve the implementation of existing legislation and to secure additional reductions in air pollution. Air quality state and impacts are discussed in the briefing on outdoor air quality in urban areas ( AIRS_PO3.1, 2016 )(2) and the Eutrophication of terrestrial ecosystems to due to air pollution briefing ( AIRS_PO1.1, 2016 )(3)    Policy targets and progress    The NECD (EU, 2001) and the Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 1979) set emission ceilings for 2010 for European countries for SO x  (SO 2 in the NECD), NO x , NMVOCs and NH 3 . The 2012 amended Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 2012) also sets 2020 emission reduction commitments for these same four pollutants, as well as for PM 2.5 .   Anthropogenic emissions of certain air pollutants have decreased in both the EU-28 (Figure 1, left panel)and the EEA-33 (the 33 member countries of the European Environment Agency, which includes the 28 EU Member States)between 2005 and 2014 (Figure 1, right panel). However, for both NH 3  and PM 2.5 , little progress has been made in reducing emissions.   A number of Member States have reported emissions above the levels of their 2010 emission ceilings set out in the NECD, and some significantly so (by 10% or more) (EEA, 2016b):     NO x : 12 Member States exceeded their ceilings in 2010 and six Member States continued to exceed their emission ceilings in 2014 (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg).   NMVOCs: five Member States exceeded their ceilings in 2010 and three Member States exceeded ceilings in 2014 (Denmark, Germany and Ireland).   SO 2 : all Member States met emission ceilings for SO 2  in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.   NH 3 : six Member States (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain) exceeded their ceilings in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.     Future reductions in emissions are still required in most Member States in order for them to meet their respective emission reduction commitments for 2020, as set out in the amended Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 2012).   Figure 1. Trends in emissions of air pollutants in the EU-28 (left) and in the EEA-33 (right), 20052014         Source:  National emissions reported to the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP Convention), EEA, 2016c     In the paragraphs below, the trends in emissionsof the individual pollutants over the 2005 to 2014 period are discussed.   Nitrogen oxides   NO x emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 continue to decrease and are more than 25% below 2005 levels. Emission reductions have, however, not been as great as originally anticipated. This is because real-world driving emissions in the road transport sector  especially for diesel passenger vehicles and vans  are, on average, four or five times higher than the European emission standards by vehicle type that all vehicles must meet in a laboratory testing procedure. The transport sector presently contributes 46% of total EU NO x emissions (47% in the EEA 33; EEA, 2016a).   Sulphur oxides   In 2014, SO x emissions had fallen to approximately 40% of their 2005 levels for the EU-28 and 54% of their 2005 levels for the EEA-33. The energy production anddistribution sectorhas been responsible for the largest reductions in emissions. This has happened for various reasons, including the closure of a number of old or uneconomical large combustion plants, which typically burn coal, and improvements in energy efficiency at industrial facilities, which have also reduced emissions.   Non-methane volatile organic compounds    NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen by approximately 24% and 27% compared with their 2005 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. The largest source of NMVOC emissions is solvent and product use. Various EU measures have helped to reduce emissions over the past two decades, including stricter requirements for industrial facilities, limits on the solvent content of paints and mandatory vapour recovery equipment at petrol stations.   Ammonia    NH 3 emissions have remained largely stable since 2005 compared with the other pollutants. They fell by only 4% from their 2005 level in the EU-28, while in the EEA-33 NH 3 emissions have actually increased by almost 10% since 2005. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH 3 : they arise primarily from the decomposition of animal manure and fertiliser application. There are a number of available technical measures to mitigate ammonia emissions, yet little progress in reducing them is evident in the agricultural sector.   Particulate matter   Emissions of primary PM 2.5  (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5m or less) have reduced by almost 20%for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28 compared with their 2005 levels. Most PM 2.5 emissions come from small combustion plants at commercial and institutional facilities, as well as from households. Although the recently agreed Medium Combustion Plants Directive (EU, 2015) will help reduce future emissions of PM 2.5 from many facilities, it remains challenging for many authorities to regulate and reduce emissions from residential combustion. The latter is an important source of air pollution in many Member States. Road transport is the second most important source of PM 2.5 .   Based on this assessment of the progress made in reducing emissions of the individual pollutants, current projections suggest that the EU is on target to meet the 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitment (albeit with some uncertainty with respect to PM 2.5 ) (IIASAA, 2014).     Country-level information     Table 1 shows both the 2014 emissions and the Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitments for 2020. The colours indicate to what extent the 2014 emissions exceed the 2020 emission reduction commitment for each Member State and the EU as a whole.      Table 1. 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitments and 2014 emissions of air pollutants by Member States        Source: based on EEA (2016d).    As noted earlier, future reductions in emissions will still be required in most Member States so that they meet their respective emission reduction commitments for 2020, set out in the Gothenburg Protocol. However, a number of Member States already report emissions below the level required by 2020.   Outlook beyond 2020   As part of the Clean Air Policy Programme for Europe (EC, 2013), the European Commission has proposed a revised NECD, which proposes national emission reduction commitments for 2020 in line with those already agreed under the amended 2012 Gothenburg Protocol and new emission reduction commitments for 2030 and beyond. The 2030 commitments would apply to the pollutants currently covered (NO x , NMVOCs, SO 2 , and NH 3 ) and would add PM 2.5 . In the absence of new commitments to reduce emissions, only slow progress in further reducing emissions beyond 2030 is anticipated. The European Commissions proposal would deliver, by 2030, an estimated 52% reduction in premature mortality compared with the current emissions baseline (2005). Additional measures beyond the NECD proposal are still needed if Europe is to achieve the long-term objective of air pollution levels that do not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment.    About the indicator    This indicator deals with the emissions of keyanthropogenicair pollutants.It covers anthropogenic emissions of the air pollutants SO x , NO x , NH 3 , NMVOCs, and PM 2.5  for the years 2005 to 2014. Data are taken from the latest EU emission inventory submission to the LRTAP Convention (EEA, 2016b, 2016c).,<table class='plain' style='width: 1000px;'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p style='width: 140px; text-align: left;'><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p style='text-align: left; '><b>Indicator pasttrend</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p style='width: 140px; text-align: left;'><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: left; '><strong>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Emissions of the main air pollutants in Europe (sulphur oxides: SO<sub>2</sub>; nitrogen oxides: NO<sub>x</sub>; ammonia: NH<sub>3</sub>; non-methane volatile organic compounds: NMVOCs; fine particulate matter: PM<sub>2.5</sub>)<br /><br /></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><strong>EU 28</strong></p> <p style='text-align: center; '>SO<sub>2, </sub> NO<sub>x, </sub>NMVOCs,<span> NH<sub><span>3</span></sub></span>, PM<sub>2.5</sub></p> <p style='text-align: center; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/766e1dac-0343-4746-93f3-e171ba6c3320.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> <p></p> <p></p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; '> <p><strong>EEA 33</strong></p> <p align='center'>SO<sub><span>2, </span></sub> NO<sub>x, </sub><span>NMVOCs</span>, PM<sub><span>2.5</span></sub></p> <p><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/766e1dac-0343-4746-93f3-e171ba6c3320.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> <p align='center'><span><span>NH<sub><span>3 </span></sub></span></span></p> <p align='center'><span><sub><span></span></sub> <em></em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-triangle-deteriorating-trend/@@images/f5cc1880-13f8-4b92-90a2-1b983a575158.jpeg' alt='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' class='image-inline' title='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' /><br /></span></p> <p align='center'><span></span><span><br /></span></p> <p></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '><span></span><span>Reduce air pollutant emissions in accordance with<br />the requirements of the amended Gothenburg<br />Protocol by the following percentages by 2005:<br />SO<sub>2</sub> 59 %, NO<sub>X</sub> 42 %, NH<sub>3</sub> 6 %, NMVOCs 28 %, PM<sub>2.5</sub><br />22 % compared to 2005 levels</span></p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; ' width='121'> <p></p> <p><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' alt='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> <p></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='6'> <p>Air pollutant emissions have declined and current projections suggest that the EU is on target to meet the 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitments</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2><span>Setting the Scene</span></h2> <p>Air pollution is responsible for more than 400 000 premature deaths in Europe each year.

Emission reductions have, however, not been as great as originally anticipated. This is because real-world driving emissions in the road transport sector  especially for diesel passenger vehicles and vans  are, on average, four or five times higher than the European emission standards by vehicle type that all vehicles must meet in a laboratory testing procedure. The transport sector presently contributes 46% of total EU NO<sub>x</sub>emissions (47% in the EEA 33; EEA, 2016a).</p> <h3>Sulphur oxides</h3> <p>In 2014, SO<sub>x</sub>emissions had fallen to approximately 40% of their 2005 levels for the EU-28 and 54% of their 2005 levels for the EEA-33. The energy production anddistribution sectorhas been responsible for the largest reductions in emissions. This has happened for various reasons, including the closure of a number of old or uneconomical large combustion plants, which typically burn coal, and improvements in energy efficiency at industrial facilities, which have also reduced emissions.</p> <h3>Non-methane volatile organic compounds<b> </b></h3> <p>NMVOC emissions for the EEA-33 and the EU-28 have fallen by approximately 24% and 27% compared with their 2005 levels, and nearly all countries have reported emissions below their 2010 emission ceilings. The largest source of NMVOC emissions is solvent and product use. Various EU measures have helped to reduce emissions over the past two decades, including stricter requirements for industrial facilities, limits on the solvent content of paints and mandatory vapour recovery equipment at petrol stations.</p> <h3>Ammonia<b> </b></h3> <p>NH<sub>3</sub>emissions have remained largely stable since 2005 compared with the other pollutants. They fell by only 4% from their 2005 level in the EU-28, while in the EEA-33 NH<sub>3</sub>emissions have actually increased by almost 10% since 2005. Agriculture dominates emissions of NH<sub>3</sub>: they arise primarily from the decomposition of animal manure and fertiliser application. There are a number of available technical measures to mitigate ammonia emissions, yet little progress in reducing them is evident in the agricultural sector.</p> <h3>Particulate matter</h3> <p>Emissions of primary PM<sub>2.5</sub> (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5m or less) have reduced by almost 20%for both the EEA-33 and the EU-28 compared with their 2005 levels. Most PM<sub>2.5</sub>emissions come from small combustion plants at commercial and institutional facilities, as well as from households. Although the recently agreed Medium Combustion Plants Directive (EU, 2015) will help reduce future emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub>from many facilities, it remains challenging for many authorities to regulate and reduce emissions from residential combustion. The latter is an important source of air pollution in many Member States. Road transport is the second most important source of PM<sub>2.5</sub>.</p> <p>Based on this assessment of the progress made in reducing emissions of the individual pollutants, current projections suggest that the EU is on target to meet the 2020 Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitment (albeit with some uncertainty with respect to PM<sub>2.5</sub>) (IIASAA, 2014).</p> <div> <h2><strong>Country-level information</strong></h2> </div> <p>Table 1 shows both the 2014 emissions and the Gothenburg Protocol emission reduction commitments for 2020.

However, a number of Member States already report emissions below the level required by 2020.</p> <h2>Outlook beyond 2020</h2> <p>As part of the Clean Air Policy Programme for Europe (EC, 2013), the European Commission has proposed a revised NECD, which proposes national emission reduction commitments for 2020 in line with those already agreed under the amended 2012 Gothenburg Protocol and new emission reduction commitments for 2030 and beyond. The 2030 commitments would apply to the pollutants currently covered (NO<sub>x</sub>, NMVOCs, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub>) and would add PM<sub>2.5</sub>. In the absence of new commitments to reduce emissions, only slow progress in further reducing emissions beyond 2030 is anticipated. The European Commissions proposal would deliver, by 2030, an estimated 52% reduction in premature mortality compared with the current emissions baseline (2005). Additional measures beyond the NECD proposal are still needed if Europe is to achieve the long-term objective of air pollution levels that do not lead to unacceptable harm to human health and the environment.</p> <h2><span>About the indicator</span></h2> <p>This indicator deals with the emissions of keyanthropogenicair pollutants.It covers anthropogenic emissions of the air pollutants SO<sub>x</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, NMVOCs, and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>for the years 2005 to 2014.

Ceilings for 2010 were set for emissions of key air pollutants under the Gothenburg Protocol of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) and under the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD). The Gothenburg Protocol further specifies emission reduction commitments for 2020 for selected pollutants. Emissions of these pollutants have generally decreased significantly over the past two decades. While the EU as a whole is on course to meet its 2020 emission reduction commitments, a number of EU Member States continue to report emissions above their respective Gothenburg Protocol and NECD ceilings for 2010. In 2013, the European Commission proposed a revised NECD that includes new national emission reduction commitments for 2020 and beyond.

This briefing presents trends in the shares of environmental and labour taxes in total tax revenues. The reasoning that it is more environmentally and economically sound to tax pollution and resource use than to tax labour is based on the theory that increased taxes on resources should incentivise a reduction in their use. Environmental taxation can allow fiscal consolidation while, at the same time, encouraging restructuring towards a resource-efficient economy (EC, 2011). Environmental tax reforms can change behaviour, redirecting consumption towards less taxed and less polluting commodities. Reducing taxation on labour and investment (for example income tax and corporation tax) can also encourage economic growth and, through targeted investment, can specifically encourage the creation of green jobs, for example in the recycling and energy efficiency sectors (EEA, 2013).      Policy targets and progress      The Roadmap for a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) includes a milestone that, by 2020, a major shift of taxation from labour towards the environment will lead to a substantial increase in the share of environmental taxes that contribute to public revenues, in line with the best practice of Member States.       Figure 1.  Shares of environment and labour taxes in total tax revenues from taxes and social contributions, EU           For the EU as a whole, there has been no positive progress over the last decade (Figure 1). At the beginning of the 2000s, there was a slight increase in environmental taxes relative to labour taxes, but, since the economic downturn, this has not been sustained. The share of total revenues from taxes on labour has consistently remained at approximately eight times that of revenues from environmental taxes.   The years following the economic downturn offered the opportunity to use environmental fiscal reform to address rising unemployment. The lack of any positive movement at the EU level indicates that this opportunity has not been capitalised upon. This lack of progress comes in spite of renewed interest in environmental fiscal reform driven by various factors, including the push for fiscal consolidation and the growing recognition of the financial burden of certain measures, such as fossil fuel subsidies. The recent sharp fall in global oil prices is seen by some as providing an opportunity to launch carbon-pricing mechanisms and to reform fossil fuel subsidies (IEEP, 2015).   In addition to taxing energy and carbon, resource taxes offer opportunities to improve material resource efficiency ( see the Resource efficiency briefing (AIRS_PO2.1, 2016)  1 ). Such taxes are still largely unused in the EU, comprising only 3.6% of revenues from all environmental taxes in 2014, which corresponds to 0.09% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the EU (Figure 2). There is no sign of an increase in the share of resource taxes in environmental taxes over recent years, despite an increasing focus on material resources in EU policy, represented, for example, by the 2011 Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) and the 2015 Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015a).    Figure 2.  Environment taxes by type as share of GDP, EU           This lack of progress may be a result of a number of obstacles that have been identified in relation to environmental fiscal reform. In its 2015 review of tax reforms in Member States (EC, 2015b), the European Commission refers to three key barriers in relation to the implementation of environmental taxation: (1) the potentially regressive nature of environmental taxes and possible associated equity issues; (2) the potentially harmful effect on the competitiveness of the sectors concerned; and (3) the administrative and enforcement costs of raising these taxes. The Commission, nevertheless, offers successful implementation strategies, namely transparency and early engagement with those affected by the tax, gradual implementation of the tax according to a pre-announced schedule and making such tax measures part of a broader policy package designed to achieve the specific environmental objective.   Analysis by the European Commission also suggests that higher energy taxes, compensated for by a reduction in labour taxation, can, in fact, improve competitiveness (Barrios et al., 2014). However, the administrative and enforcement costs must be in proportion to the political and environmental objectives that the tax aims to achieve. Other studies also suggest that any potentially negative impacts of environmental taxes can be reduced or addressed through careful design and implementation of tax adjustments (IEEP, 2015).   Another factor that limits changes to the relative levels of taxes is the high level of political attention that is generated by any changes to a countrys tax system. This can make any changes difficult and will tend to slow the pace of change. The political difficulties of modifying the fiscal system are reflected in a recent study by the European Commission, which assessed the environmental fiscal reform potential for the EU for different scenarios of political acceptance in various Member States (EC, 2016).   The absence of policies promoting a tax shift from labour to environmentally damaging goods and practices over past years, and the lack of plans by Member States to implement these changes, makes it unlikely that the 2020 objective will be met.    Country level information    When comparing the levels of environmental taxation between European countries, differences should be analysed with caution. For example, low revenues from environmental taxes can result from relatively low environmental tax rates, or from modified behavioural patterns resulting from high tax rates. On the other hand, higher levels of environmental tax revenues in a country could result from low tax rates that incentivise non-residents to purchase taxed products from the other side of a border (as is the case for petrol or diesel) (Eurostat, 2016).      Figure 3. Shares of environment and labour taxes in total tax revenues from taxes and social contributions                Data sources:   Eurostat.  Shares of environmental and labour taxes in total tax revenues from taxes and social contributions (tsdgo410)      European Commission.  Data on taxation         Explore interactive version        Figure 3 illustrates the large differences in the share of labour taxation in 2014 between countries, ranging from 32.9% in Bulgaria to 58.6% in Sweden. In 2014, only three EU Member States (Croatia, Greece and Slovenia) showed a share of above 10% of environmental taxes in total revenues from taxes and social contributions.   Five countries shifted taxation away from labour and towards the environment between 2003 and 2014 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia), while 10 countries moved in the opposite direction (Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain); however, some of these changes are quite small.   The 2015 review of tax reforms in Member States by the European Commission (EC, 2015b) identified a group consisting of approximately one third of EU Member States where there is particular scope for improving the design of environmental taxes. Suggested ways forward include restructuring vehicle taxation, indexing environmental taxes to inflation and adjusting fuel excise duties to reflect the carbon and energy content of different fuels.    Outlook beyond 2020    A recent report by the European Commission analysed the extent to which environmental taxes could be increased, based on good practice (EC, 2016). This report found that environmental taxes could increase across the EU from an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2013 to 3.6% by 2030. Countries reported that politically feasible increases in environmental taxes, especially energy taxes, are lower than estimated optimal rates. However, this gap reduces as one looks further into the future. The report concluded that, while, in the short term, the good-practice scenario is viewed as challenging, over the longer term nearly all the suggested taxes can be viewed as politically feasible.   The fiscal outlook in Europe has heightened political interest in the potential of revenue-neutral tax-shifting policies whereby the revenues from environmental taxes are used to reduce labour taxes. Longer term developments, including demographic changes and technological breakthroughs on energy and transport in the transition to a low-carbon, green economy, will contribute to the erosion of the current tax bases in European countries. These expected trends challenge the overall basis of current thinking on tax shifts. Some countries have already developed  new environmental tax instruments,  but much more work needs to be done on the design of resilient, long-term tax systems in Europe in the face of such systemic challenges (EEA, 2016).     About the indicator     Environmental taxes are defined as taxes whose tax base is a physical unit (or proxy of it) of something that has a proven, specific negative impact on the environment. Current environmental tax revenues stem from four types of taxes: energy taxes, transport taxes, pollution taxes and resource taxes. Pollution and resource taxes are reported for only 16 EU Member States, with Eurostat estimating the tax levels for the remaining countries.   Taxes on labour are defined as all personal income taxes, payroll taxes and the social contributions of employees and employers that are levied on labour income (both employed and non-employed).   Eurostat gathers data on environmental taxes for four categories (energy, transport, pollution and resources) using Table 9 from the European System of Accounts transmission programme. Since 2013, Eurostat has also collected data on environmental taxes by economic activity at a more detailed level, in application of Regulation (EU) No691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts. The methodological basis is outlined in the Eurostat publication Environmental taxes  A statistical guide (Eurostat, 2013).,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> <p></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Share of environmental and labour taxes in total tax revenues</p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p align='center'>Environmental taxes </p> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/34c5620c-2c83-4ecd-bbb1-6a50195c1e86.jpeg' alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></p> <p align='center'></p> <p align='center'>Labour taxes</p> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/34c5620c-2c83-4ecd-bbb1-6a50195c1e86.jpeg' alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '><span>Shift taxation from labour towards the environment - 7th EAP<br /></span></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p>For the EU as a whole, there has been no positive progress over the examined period and there are no indications of any change in the coming years</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>The 7th EAP calls on the EU and Member States to consider fiscal measures in support of sustainable resource use such as shifting taxation away from labour towards pollution (EU, 2013).

In 2014, only three EU Member States (Croatia, Greece and Slovenia) showed a share of above 10% of environmental taxes in total revenues from taxes and social contributions.</p> <p>Five countries shifted taxation away from labour and towards the environment between 2003 and 2014 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia), while 10 countries moved in the opposite direction (Austria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain); however, some of these changes are quite small.</p> <p>The 2015 review of tax reforms in Member States by the European Commission (EC, 2015b) identified a group consisting of approximately one third of EU Member States where there is particular scope for improving the design of environmental taxes. Suggested ways forward include restructuring vehicle taxation, indexing environmental taxes to inflation and adjusting fuel excise duties to reflect the carbon and energy content of different fuels.</p> <h2><span>Outlook beyond 2020</span></h2> <p>A recent report by the European Commission analysed the extent to which environmental taxes could be increased, based on good practice (EC, 2016). This report found that environmental taxes could increase across the EU from an average of 2.5% of GDP in 2013 to 3.6% by 2030. Countries reported that politically feasible increases in environmental taxes, especially energy taxes, are lower than estimated optimal rates. However, this gap reduces as one looks further into the future. The report concluded that, while, in the short term, the good-practice scenario is viewed as challenging, over the longer term nearly all the suggested taxes can be viewed as politically feasible.</p> <p>The fiscal outlook in Europe has heightened political interest in the potential of revenue-neutral tax-shifting policies whereby the revenues from environmental taxes are used to reduce labour taxes. Longer term developments, including demographic changes and technological breakthroughs on energy and transport in the transition to a low-carbon, green economy, will contribute to the erosion of the current tax bases in European countries. These expected trends challenge the overall basis of current thinking on tax shifts. Some countries have already developed <span class='annotator-hl'>new environmental tax instruments,</span> but much more work needs to be done on the design of resilient, long-term tax systems in Europe in the face of such systemic challenges (EEA, 2016).</p> <div> <h2>About the indicator</h2> </div> <p>Environmental taxes are defined as taxes whose tax base is a physical unit (or proxy of it) of something that has a proven, specific negative impact on the environment. Current environmental tax revenues stem from four types of taxes: energy taxes, transport taxes, pollution taxes and resource taxes. Pollution and resource taxes are reported for only 16 EU Member States, with Eurostat estimating the tax levels for the remaining countries.</p> <p>Taxes on labour are defined as all personal income taxes, payroll taxes and the social contributions of employees and employers that are levied on labour income (both employed and non-employed).</p> <p>Eurostat gathers data on environmental taxes for four categories (energy, transport, pollution and resources) using Table 9 from the European System of Accounts transmission programme. Since 2013, Eurostat has also collected data on environmental taxes by economic activity at a more detailed level, in application of Regulation (EU) No691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts. The methodological basis is outlined in the Eurostat publication Environmental taxes  A statistical guide (Eurostat, 2013).</p>","Environmental and labour taxation",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) calls for a shift in taxes from labour towards pollution and resource use as a means of helping to achieve environmental objectives and stimulating employment and green growth. Taxes on labour remain eight times higher than environmental taxes in the EU. These relative shares in overall taxes have changed very little over the last decade and only five EU countries have decreased their shares of labour taxes while increasing their shares of environmental taxes. The main reasons for this lack of progress appear to be a combination of the political difficulty of making any changes to a countrys tax system, along with the real and perceived economic and social challenges regarding environmental taxes. Research and analysis suggest that, in order for it to be successful, this type of fiscal reform requires careful planning to avoid any negative economic and social impacts and widespread consultation that reflects good governance principles. There are no current indications from Member States that they intend to shift taxes from labour towards the environment, so the outlook for 2020 appears negative.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-03-22T11:22:23Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Czech Republic,Austria,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Netherlands,Germany,Greece,Belgium,Lithuania,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",,"published","Policy instruments","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/environmental-and-labour-taxation","Briefing (all)","2014,2003,2004,2015,2016,2005,2017,2006,2018,2007,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2012,2001,2013,2002","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

Greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of climate change. Climate change will further aggravate environmental problems by causing prolonged droughts and heatwaves, floods, storms, forest fires, and soil and coastal erosion, as well as new or more virulent forms of human, animal or plant disease. Climate change is also expected to significantly increase the pressure on Europes water resources.    Policy targets and progress    The EU has committed to achieving a reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels (EEA, 2016a). This objective is embodied in both European and international commitments and targets, which clearly align with the objectives of the 7th EAP described above.   The overall emissions reduction target is separated into one EU-wide target for large industrial installations, covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and 28 binding national targets for all the emissions that are not in the EU ETS. These national targets, set under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), cover sectors such as households, buildings, transport, agriculture, services, waste and smaller industrial installations. The EU ETS is expected to deliver a 21% reduction in its emissions, and the non-ETS sectors should reduce emissions by 9% by 2020 (both compared with 2005 levels). Together, these will lead to a reduction of 20% in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels.   Within the ETS system, the EU sets limits on emissions from high-emitting industry sectors. With these limits as a reference, companies can buy and sell emission allowances as needed. This cap-and-trade approach gives companies the flexibility they need to cut their emissions in the most cost-effective way. The EU ETS covers more than 11000 power stations and manufacturing plants in the 28 EU Member States, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Emissions from commercial aircraft flying within and between most of these countries are also covered. In 2014, EU ETS emissions represented around 42% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.    Figure 1. GHG emission trends, projections and targets in the EU, 1990-2050.         In 2015, EU greenhouse gas emissions were already 22% below 1990 levels (see Figure 1). Preliminary greenhouse emission estimates indicate an expected 0.7 % increase for 2015 (EEA, 2016b). This follows an exceptional 4.0 % reduction the previous year, which was due to a particularly warm winter. Emissions from industries in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continued to decrease in 2015. On the other hand, emissions not included in the ETS increased. In particular, transport emissions increased for the second year in a row.   The EU has improved its energy intensity over time. This has been because of energy efficiency improvements, structural changes in the economy and reduced energy consumption as a result of the 2008 economic downturn (for more information, see the Energy efficiency briefing ( AIRS_PO2.7, 2016 ) 1 ). This trend is primarily responsible for the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions observed in the EU between 2005 and 2013 (EEA, 2014). Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can also be attributed to a change in the mix of fossil fuels used and the increasing use of carbon-free energy sources, including renewable energy sources (RES) (for more information, see the Renewable energies briefing ( AIRS_PO2.9, 2016 ) 2 ), reflecting the effects of policies and measures supporting the deployment of RES (e.g. feed-in tariffs), the establishment of a carbon price through the EU ETS, and external factors such as fluctuations in fossil fuel prices (EEA, 2015a). The strong growth in the use of RES  particularly wind, solar and biomass  and the resulting increased proportion of RES in electricity production have also contributed to the reduction in emissions. Demand for energy to heat households was also lower during this period, as Europe has experienced milder winters on average since 1990 (EEA, 2015a, 2016b and 2016c).   As projected by the EU Member States, emissions are expected to decrease further to 23% by 2020 with the current measures that are already in place. Additional measures (currently planned by Member States) could further reduce emissions to almost 25% below 1990 levels. Most of the savings in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to take place as a result of the EU ETS (EEA, 2015a).    Country level information    To meet the 2020 GHG target, the EU adopted a climate and energy package in 2009, comprising a legislative set of binding targets, which defined a single target for all EU emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and a set of national targets for all other emissions not covered by the EU ETS. Since 2005, which was the first year of operation of the EU ETS, the ETS sectors have seen reductions in emissions of approximately 24%. The main sectors that experienced particularly large decreases in emissions were cement clinker and lime. Reductions in emissions from combustion installations, which represent more than 70% of all ETS emissions and are dominated by electricity generation, are largely as a result of changes to the mixture of fuels used to produce heat and electricity. The use of hard coal and lignite fuels in electricity generation has declined since 2005 and electricity generation from renewable sources has increased considerably. The reduction in emissions may also have been enhanced as a result of improvements in transformation efficiency for electricity generation, which means that less primary energy was necessary to generate a constant quantity of electricity. The cement, lime and iron and steel sectors follow similar trends, with emissions increasing up to 2007 and then decreasing. These reductions in emissions were, to a large extent, driven by reduced production as a result of the economic downturn.   In contrast to the sectors in the EU ETS, which are regulated at EU level, it is the responsibility of EU Member States to define and implement national policies and measures to limit emissions from the sectors covered by the ESD, the residential and commercial, transport, agriculture, waste and smaller industrial installation sectors. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from the ESD sectors represented approximately 58% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.   Figure 2.  GHG emissions under the Effort Sharing Decision, by country         The national emissions targets for 2020 range from a 20% reduction in emissions (compared with 2005 levels) to a 20% increase. Less wealthy countries are allowed emission increases in the ESD sectors, because their relatively higher economic growth is likely to be accompanied by higher emissions. Nevertheless, their targets represent a limit on their emissions compared with the emissions projected using business-as-usual growth rates. All Member States are therefore required to make an effort to reduce emissions (EC, 2015).   Examples of potential policies and measures that could be implemented to reduce emissions include reducing transport demand, promoting public transport, a shift away from transport based on fossil fuels, support schemes for the retrofitting of building stock, more efficient heating and cooling systems, renewable energy for heating and cooling, more climate-friendly farming practices and the conversion of livestock manure to biogas (EC, 2015).   The assessment of current progress towards the ESD targets compares the non-ETS emissions for each year with the annual national targets. In 2014, all Member States but one (Malta) were below their national ESD targets. The 2015 proxy data seem to confirm this trend across the EU (Figure 2).   National projections show that, in most Member States, ESD emissions will remain below annual ESD targets until 2020. However, in five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) emissions in 2020 could exceed targets if no additional measures are implemented.   Outlook beyond 2020   The EU has also adopted a long-term goal for 2050 of reducing Europes greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% compared with 1990 levels. To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this objective, in 2014 the European Council adopted a new set of climate and energy targets for 2030 (EC, 2014). This includes a binding target of reducing emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels.   Looking towards 2030, projections from Member States show that both the current measures in place and the additional national measures that were in the planning stage at the time when projections were made will not be able to deliver sufficient savings to enable the EU to achieve the reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels (Figure 1). The pace of greenhouse gas emission reductions is projected to slow down after 2020, despite the fact that mid- and long-term targets will require more rapid reductions. Existing policies and measures are expected to result in a reduction in emissions of 26% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and the implementation of additional measures could increase this reduction to 29%.   Because of this projected shortfall, new policies and measures are currently being developed at EU level to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These policy options include measures applicable to the transport and land use sectors, as well as the reform of the ETS, which includes a more stringent cap to achieve reductions beyond 2020, as well as a post-2020 ESD and measures to enhance energy efficiency based on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.   About the indicator   The indicator presents past and future trends for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and IPCC reporting guidelines, the indicator covers the following greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3 ). These are weighted by their global warming potential, aggregated and presented in CO 2 -equivalent units. The list of gases does not include the greenhouse gases that are ozone-depleting substances and are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. The indicator covers emissions from international aviation and excludes emissions or removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) and international shipping. For the past, the indicator uses the greenhouse gas inventory and ETS data. It also uses projection data reported by EU Member States in two scenarios: a with existing measures (WEM) scenario and a with additional measures (WAM) scenario. The WAM scenario takes into account measures planned but not yet adopted. However, not all EU Member States reported a WAM scenario, so the predicted reduction might not take all planned measures into account and therefore may be an underestimate.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='144'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td width='59'> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td width='173'> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td width='174'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='144'> <p>Total greenhouse gas emission trends and projections</p> </td> <td width='59'> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> </td> <td width='173'> <p>Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared with 1990 levels - 2020 Climate and Energy Package</p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; ' width='174'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' alt='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' /> <p></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='550'> <p>The decreasing trend of greenhouse gases and the future evolution as projected by the EU Member States indicate that the 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target will be met</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <div class='pageBreak'><span><br /></span></div> <h2><span>Setting the scene</span></h2> <p>The 7th EAP includes the objective for the EU to meet its 2020 climate and energy targets and to work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% by 2050, compared with 1990 levels (EU, 2013).

Preliminary greenhouse emission estimates indicate an expected 0.7 % increase for 2015 (EEA, 2016b). This follows an exceptional 4.0 % reduction the previous year, which was due to a particularly warm winter. Emissions from industries in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continued to decrease in 2015. On the other hand, emissions not included in the ETS increased. In particular, transport emissions increased for the second year in a row.</p> <p>The EU has improved its energy intensity over time. This has been because of energy efficiency improvements, structural changes in the economy and reduced energy consumption as a result of the 2008 economic downturn (for more information, see the Energy efficiency briefing (<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/energy-efficiency' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO2.7, 2016</a>)<sup>1</sup>). This trend is primarily responsible for the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions observed in the EU between 2005 and 2013 (EEA, 2014). Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can also be attributed to a change in the mix of fossil fuels used and the increasing use of carbon-free energy sources, including renewable energy sources (RES) (for more information, see the Renewable energies briefing (<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/renewable-energies' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO2.9, 2016</a>)<sup>2</sup>), reflecting the effects of policies and measures supporting the deployment of RES (e.g. feed-in tariffs), the establishment of a carbon price through the EU ETS, and external factors such as fluctuations in fossil fuel prices (EEA, 2015a). The strong growth in the use of RES  particularly wind, solar and biomass  and the resulting increased proportion of RES in electricity production have also contributed to the reduction in emissions. Demand for energy to heat households was also lower during this period, as Europe has experienced milder winters on average since 1990 (EEA, 2015a, 2016b and 2016c).</p> <p>As projected by the EU Member States, emissions are expected to decrease further to 23% by 2020 with the current measures that are already in place. Additional measures (currently planned by Member States) could further reduce emissions to almost 25% below 1990 levels. Most of the savings in greenhouse gas emissions are expected to take place as a result of the EU ETS (EEA, 2015a).</p> <h2><span>Country level information</span></h2> <p>To meet the 2020 GHG target, the EU adopted a climate and energy package in 2009, comprising a legislative set of binding targets, which defined a single target for all EU emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and a set of national targets for all other emissions not covered by the EU ETS. Since 2005, which was the first year of operation of the EU ETS, the ETS sectors have seen reductions in emissions of approximately 24%. The main sectors that experienced particularly large decreases in emissions were cement clinker and lime. Reductions in emissions from combustion installations, which represent more than 70% of all ETS emissions and are dominated by electricity generation, are largely as a result of changes to the mixture of fuels used to produce heat and electricity. The use of hard coal and lignite fuels in electricity generation has declined since 2005 and electricity generation from renewable sources has increased considerably. The reduction in emissions may also have been enhanced as a result of improvements in transformation efficiency for electricity generation, which means that less primary energy was necessary to generate a constant quantity of electricity. The cement, lime and iron and steel sectors follow similar trends, with emissions increasing up to 2007 and then decreasing. These reductions in emissions were, to a large extent, driven by reduced production as a result of the economic downturn.</p> <p>In contrast to the sectors in the EU ETS, which are regulated at EU level, it is the responsibility of EU Member States to define and implement national policies and measures to limit emissions from the sectors covered by the ESD, the residential and commercial, transport, agriculture, waste and smaller industrial installation sectors. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from the ESD sectors represented approximately 58% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><strong>Figure 2. <b><span>GHG emissions under the Effort Sharing Decision, by country</span></b></strong></h4> <p><iframe height='661' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/data-visualization-43/embed-chart?chart=chart_1&amp;chartWidth=602&amp;chartHeight=565&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7D.googlechart_filters%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7Ddiv%5Bid*%3D%22googlechart_wm_%22%5D%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;skipdaviztitle=true&amp;skipcharttitle=true&amp;padding=13%2C7%2C160%2C65' width='604'></iframe></p> <p>The national emissions targets for 2020 range from a 20% reduction in emissions (compared with 2005 levels) to a 20% increase. Less wealthy countries are allowed emission increases in the ESD sectors, because their relatively higher economic growth is likely to be accompanied by higher emissions. Nevertheless, their targets represent a limit on their emissions compared with the emissions projected using business-as-usual growth rates. All Member States are therefore required to make an effort to reduce emissions (EC, 2015).</p> <p>Examples of potential policies and measures that could be implemented to reduce emissions include reducing transport demand, promoting public transport, a shift away from transport based on fossil fuels, support schemes for the retrofitting of building stock, more efficient heating and cooling systems, renewable energy for heating and cooling, more climate-friendly farming practices and the conversion of livestock manure to biogas (EC, 2015).</p> <p>The assessment of current progress towards the ESD targets compares the non-ETS emissions for each year with the annual national targets. In 2014, all Member States but one (Malta) were below their national ESD targets. The 2015 proxy data seem to confirm this trend across the EU (Figure 2).</p> <p>National projections show that, in most Member States, ESD emissions will remain below annual ESD targets until 2020. However, in five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) emissions in 2020 could exceed targets if no additional measures are implemented.</p> <h2>Outlook beyond 2020</h2> <p>The EU has also adopted a long-term goal for 2050 of reducing Europes greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% compared with 1990 levels. To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this objective, in 2014 the European Council adopted a new set of climate and energy targets for 2030 (EC, 2014). This includes a binding target of reducing emissions by at least 40% compared with 1990 levels.</p> <p>Looking towards 2030, projections from Member States show that both the current measures in place and the additional national measures that were in the planning stage at the time when projections were made will not be able to deliver sufficient savings to enable the EU to achieve the reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels (Figure 1). The pace of greenhouse gas emission reductions is projected to slow down after 2020, despite the fact that mid- and long-term targets will require more rapid reductions. Existing policies and measures are expected to result in a reduction in emissions of 26% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and the implementation of additional measures could increase this reduction to 29%.</p> <p>Because of this projected shortfall, new policies and measures are currently being developed at EU level to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These policy options include measures applicable to the transport and land use sectors, as well as the reform of the ETS, which includes a more stringent cap to achieve reductions beyond 2020, as well as a post-2020 ESD and measures to enhance energy efficiency based on the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies.</p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>The indicator presents past and future trends for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and IPCC reporting guidelines, the indicator covers the following greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>). These are weighted by their global warming potential, aggregated and presented in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent units. The list of gases does not include the greenhouse gases that are ozone-depleting substances and are controlled by the Montreal Protocol. The indicator covers emissions from international aviation and excludes emissions or removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) and international shipping. For the past, the indicator uses the greenhouse gas inventory and ETS data. It also uses projection data reported by EU Member States in two scenarios: a with existing measures (WEM) scenario and a with additional measures (WAM) scenario. The WAM scenario takes into account measures planned but not yet adopted. However, not all EU Member States reported a WAM scenario, so the predicted reduction might not take all planned measures into account and therefore may be an underestimate.</p>","Greenhouse gas emissions",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) supports the objective of reducing EU greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (compared with 1990) by 2020. The EU also has a longer term objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80  95% by 2050 and an agreed target of a 40% reduction by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels).</p> <p>Emissions projections indicate that Europe should meet its 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. In spite of a slight increase in 2015, total EU greenhouse gas emissions (including international aviation) were in 2015 22 % below the 1990 levels, therefore well below the 2020 target. According to national projections aggregated at EU level, greenhouse gas emissions are expected to decrease further by 2020. In the longer term, EU Member States expect that the pace of these reductions will slow and planned reductions will result in EU emissions of between only 26% and 29% below 1990 levels by 2030, falling short of the 40% reduction target. However, these projections do not reflect the latest EU-level policy developments that are linked to the implementation of the recently endorsed 2030 target.</p> <p>The main reasons for the observed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are a reduction in the energy intensity of the economy, switching to less carbon-intensive fuels, and an increase in the use of renewable energy sources. Weather conditions and the economy have also played important roles in the overall reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-27T12:28:11Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Czech Republic,Austria,Cyprus,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Germany,Greece,Netherlands,Lithuania,Belgium,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Climate change mitigation","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/greenhouse-gas-emission","Briefing (all)","2003,2014,2015,2004,2005,2016,2017,2006,2007,2018,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2012,2001,2002,2013","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

Levels of saturated fat and red meat consumption remain above dietary guidelines and result in high GHG and nitrogen emissions             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016       Setting the Scene    The 7th EAP calls for changes in consumption patterns and lifestyles to reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption, in particular in the food, housing and mobility sectors (EU, 2013). Meat and dairy products contribute around 6% of the economic value but 25% of the environmental impacts caused by total final consumption in the EU (Weidema et al., 2008). The food sector contributes strongly to climate change, eutrophication, land take and a host of other environmental problems (Bailey et al., 2014). This briefing presents trends in the consumption of animal-based food products (meat, dairy, fish and seafood), as a reduction in the demand for these products and a shift to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce the EUs environmental footprint while also delivering health benefits (EuroHealthNet, 2013). For the housing and mobility sectors, please see the Household energy consumption briefing ( AIRS_PO2.8, 2016 ) 1  and the Transport greenhouse gas emissions briefing ( AIRS_PO2.9, 2016 ). 2    Policy targets and progress   The food system is a major driver of environmental change, with implications for energy and water security. Although the EU has no explicit food policy, the food system cuts across a wide range of policy areas including agriculture, fisheries, biodiversity and health. The 7th EAP and the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) share the objectives of reducing the impact of food production and consumption and reducing resource inputs by tackling food waste in particular.   Different food products have very different environmental footprints. Diets characterised by a high intake of animal products result in consumption of saturated fat and red meat in quantities that exceed dietary recommendations. Their production requires large areas of land and results in high greenhouse gas and nitrogen emissions. Therefore, a healthier diet can result in lower environmental impacts.   Intensively farmed beef has a carbon footprint seven times that of poultry. Land use and eutrophication loading are six times and four times higher, respectively, per kilogram. The environmental footprint of pork lies somewhere between the two for most impact categories (Weidema et al., 2008). Animal welfare issues related to intensive methods of poultry rearing are also a consideration when evaluating impact. In addition, while grazing animals can contribute positively to the biodiversity of agricultural land, overgrazing contributes to the lack of improvement in the conservation status of habitats associated with agricultural ecosystems; see  EU protected habitats briefing ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ) . 3    Absolute and indexed meat, dairy and seafood consumption are shown in Figures 1 and 2.  Average per capita consumption of meat (all types),  dairy, and fish and seafood products generally increased in the EU-28 up until 2008 but have stabilised since then.    Figure 1. Average per capita consumption of meat, fish, seafood and dairy products, EU      Bovine meat consumption has reduced steadily over the monitoring period while poultry consumption has risen. The average citizen in the EU-28 ate 2.3kg less beef in 2011 than in 1995 (a 13% decrease), but 4.0kg more poultry (a 23% increase), with pork consumption remaining relatively stable (Figure 1). This shift will have led to a reduction in environmental impacts but this may have been somewhat offset by a 3.8kg per capita increase in cheese consumption. The shift from beef to poultry is also in line with health guidelines in guarding against cardiovascular disease (EuroHealthNet, 2013).   There is no explicit policy objective of reducing meat and dairy consumption for environmental reasons (Bailey et al., 2014). It may well be that European dietary changes have been brought about by increasing awareness of healthier diets, although price changes may also have had an effect. Beef prices, for example, reached record highs in 2013 (EC, 2014). Subsequently, the European Commission noted a rebound in meat and beef consumption in 2014 and projected a further 2% increase in 2015 continuing into 2016 (EC, 2015a).   Looking towards 2020, the 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is more neutral with respect to particular agricultural products than earlier CAPs. However, the recently adopted EUR500million aid package for farmers is aimed specifically at supporting cattle and pig farmers (EC, 2015b). A positive development is the increasing focus at both EU and Member State levels on reducing food waste, through actions in the  Circular Economy Package  (EC, 2015c) and  Member States waste prevention strategies .    Figure 2. Developments in per capita consumption of meat, fish and dairy products, EU (indexed)          Europeans ate on average about 2.7kg more fish and seafood each in 2011 than in 1995. About 1.8kg of this increase was consumption of freshwater fish, a 95% increase. The remaining 0.9kg of increased fish and seafood consumption comprised crustaceans (e.g. prawns, mussels), cephalopods (e.g. squid) and pelagic (bottom-dwelling) fish.   Imports of the majority of fish and crustacean products, mostly processed fish, to the EU increased by 44% between 2000 and 2010, to nearly 5million tonnes. Aquaculture in Europe accounts for about 20% of fish production. As aquaculture production in the EU-28 has been steady since 1995, increasing consumption has been met by imports (EEA, 2014).   The increase in the consumption of seafood during this period is also in line with healthy eating advice. However, again it is difficult to assess the environmental implications of this trend. About one third  of fish stocks  in the North-East Atlantic and half of the assessed commercial fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea are being fished beyond safe biological limits; for further information on the status of commercial fish stocks please see the  Marine fish stocks briefing (AIRS_PO1.5) . 4  According to the 7th EAP, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU, 2008) target to achieve good environmental status by 2020 is coming under severe pressure, due in part to continued overfishing. The 7th EAP includes a target to urgently increase efforts to ensure that healthy fish stocks are achieved. This may be compromised by the increasing consumption of fish, depending on the species consumed.   Country level information   At the country level, the proportions of various food groups in consumption, and trends in these, vary greatly. Absolute levels of meat consumption per capita across the EU-28 also differ, ranging from 53kg/year in Bulgaria to 106kg/year in Austria in 2011. The differences between countries have reduced, however, since 1995.    Outlook beyond 2020    As a major greenhouse gas emitter, the food sector may need to undergo significant changes if the EU is to meet its 2050 target for an 80  95% reduction in greenhouse gases. Current policies aimed at reducing the impact of food are mostly focused on the production side, e.g. reducing inputs and better manure and slurry management. On the consumption side, the policy focus is largely limited to labelling schemes and reducing food waste. Given the health relevance and implications of meat, dairy, fish and seafood consumption for the population, potential environmental and health co-benefits, as well as conflicts and trade-offs, should be explored when considering options to reduce environmental pressures related to food consumption. However, it seems doubtful that the necessary gains needed by 2050 in reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved without tackling meat and dairy consumption (Weidema et al., 2008; Bailey et al., 2014).   About the indicator   The indicator shows consumption of selected meat, dairy, fish and seafood products in the EU-28, between 1995 and 2011. The data were extracted from the  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO) statistics database. This indicator is defined as the supply of these products to the final consumer. The indicator is presented both in absolute quantities per capita per year (Figure 1) and in indexed form (Figure 2). The amount of food actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown in the indicator because of wasted edible food by households and other final consumers.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td width='60'> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Consumption of meat, dairy, fish and seafood</p> </td> <td width='60'> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/34c5620c-2c83-4ecd-bbb1-6a50195c1e86.jpeg' alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p>Reduce the overall impact of production and consumption in the food sector - 7th EAP</p> </td> <td width='121'> <p style='text-align: center; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>Reducing the consumption of animal products and shifting to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce environmental impacts related to food.

About one third <span class='annotator-hl'>of fish stocks</span> in the North-East Atlantic and half of the assessed commercial fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea are being fished beyond safe biological limits; for further information on the status of commercial fish stocks please see the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/natural-capital/marine-fish-stocks' class='internal-link' target='_self'>Marine fish stocks briefing (AIRS_PO1.5)</a>.<sup>4</sup> According to the 7th EAP, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (EU, 2008) target to achieve good environmental status by 2020 is coming under severe pressure, due in part to continued overfishing. The 7th EAP includes a target to urgently increase efforts to ensure that healthy fish stocks are achieved. This may be compromised by the increasing consumption of fish, depending on the species consumed.</p> <h2>Country level information</h2> <p>At the country level, the proportions of various food groups in consumption, and trends in these, vary greatly. Absolute levels of meat consumption per capita across the EU-28 also differ, ranging from 53kg/year in Bulgaria to 106kg/year in Austria in 2011. The differences between countries have reduced, however, since 1995.</p> <h2><span>Outlook beyond 2020</span></h2> <p>As a major greenhouse gas emitter, the food sector may need to undergo significant changes if the EU is to meet its 2050 target for an 80  95% reduction in greenhouse gases. Current policies aimed at reducing the impact of food are mostly focused on the production side, e.g. reducing inputs and better manure and slurry management. On the consumption side, the policy focus is largely limited to labelling schemes and reducing food waste. Given the health relevance and implications of meat, dairy, fish and seafood consumption for the population, potential environmental and health co-benefits, as well as conflicts and trade-offs, should be explored when considering options to reduce environmental pressures related to food consumption. However, it seems doubtful that the necessary gains needed by 2050 in reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved without tackling meat and dairy consumption (Weidema et al., 2008; Bailey et al., 2014).</p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>The indicator shows consumption of selected meat, dairy, fish and seafood products in the EU-28, between 1995 and 2011. The data were extracted from the <span>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (</span>FAO) statistics database. This indicator is defined as the supply of these products to the final consumer. The indicator is presented both in absolute quantities per capita per year (Figure 1) and in indexed form (Figure 2). The amount of food actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown in the indicator because of wasted edible food by households and other final consumers.</p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p>","Food consumption  animal based products",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) aims to reduce the overall impacts of production and consumption in the food sector. Animal products have been found to cause high environmental impacts, primarily related to their production. For example, meat and dairy products contribute on average 24% of the environmental impacts from total final consumption in the EU-27 (Weidema et al., 2008). Therefore, reducing the consumption of animal products and shifting to other sources of protein has the potential to reduce environmental impacts related to food production and consumption.</p> <p>Consumption of meat, dairy, and fish and seafood products increased gradually between 1995 and 2008 but has stabilised since then. The composition of meat consumption has also changed, with less beef and more poultry being consumed. However, levels of saturated fat and red meat consumption remain high, resulting in health and environmental impacts. The increase in seafood consumption has positive health implications but, depending on the fish species being consumed, can challenge other 7th EAP objectives regarding healthy marine ecosystems.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-27T15:03:20Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Czech Republic,Austria,Cyprus,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Netherlands,Greece,Germany,Belgium,Lithuania,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",,"published","Resource efficiency and waste,Agriculture","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/food-consumption-animal-based","Briefing (all)","2014,2003,2004,2015,2005,2016,2006,2017,2007,2018,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2012,2001,2013,2002","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

This will not only reduce the environmental impacts of the economy but could also have important socio-economic benefits in terms of value added and employment. This briefing presents trends in value added and employment in the EGSS. This reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy towards a sustainable economy (EC, 2010), including growing employment in the green economy (EC, 2012). In the context of globalisation and technological change, the green economy offers potential for growth. Europe as a global leader in the development of environmental goods and services has significant potential for exporting this expertise (EC, 2015a).   Policy targets and progress   The increased awareness of the need to combat environmental pollution and preserve natural resources has expanded compliance obligations within the environmental acquis and increased the supply and demand of environmental goods and services, i.e. products to prevent, measure, control, limit, minimise or correct environmental damage and resource depletion.   The Europe 2020 Strategy does not include any targets on employment or output from the eco-industry sector, i.e. the EGSS. However, the EGSS environmentaleconomic account enables reporting on trends in output and employment and so informs on progress towards a green economy.The EGSS encompassesenvironmental protection activities related to preventing, reducing and eliminating pollution and any other degradation of the environment  andresource management activities which include management of energy resources (renewable energy production and equipment and installations for heat and energy saving).      Figure 1. Employment and value added in the Environmental Goods and Services Sector (EGSS) compared with the whole economy, EU        Figure 1 shows that, since 2003, the EGSS has seen faster growth in employment and value added than the total EU economy on average. The sectors contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) has grown from 1.4% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2013, and its contribution to total employment in the EU has grown from 2.8 million full-time equivalents (FTEs) to 4.2 million over the same period.   The continued expansion of the EGSS, even in the years immediately following the financial downturn, partially resulted from innovation and Europes competitiveness in the global market, but it was also supported by public spending on environmental protection and renewable energy (Grlach et al., 2014;  AIRS_PO2.13, 2016  1 ). Some of the most successful government interventions have been investment support schemes, which provided investors with a high degree of investment certainty. Especially in difficult economic times, governments can play a significant role in supporting private investment in the EGSS by guaranteeing the certainty needed by investors (Grlach et al., 2014).   Growth in both environmental protection activities and resource management activities has been strong but has been particularly high in the resource management area, whose value added grew from EUR50.7 billion in 2003 to EUR116.7 billion in 2013 (at 2010 prices). While the renewable energy sector was the key driver in this growth, environmental protection activities still represent the major element of the EGSS, with a value added of EUR156 billion in 2013.   EU employment in environmental protection and resource management activities was estimated at 4.2 million FTEs in 2013 (Figure 2). Employment trends were mainly driven by the growing importance of activities that manage energy resources, in particular the production of energy from renewable sources, the production of wind and solar power stations and equipment and installations for heat and energy saving (Eurostat, 2016).        Figure 2. Employment by activity in the Environmental Goods and Services Sector, EU          Despite the successes of the sector, recent trends are not so positive, with growth in employment and value added in the sector having slowed since 2011. This may be explained by increasing competition from the United States and China (Grlach et al., 2014) and a decrease in domestic investments in renewable energy. In 2013, EU investment in renewables fell by 44% compared with the previous year as a result of ongoing uncertainty on the future of support mechanisms and lower investment capacity in some EU countries (UNEP, 2016) ( AIRS_PO2.6, 2016 ). 2  Overall, the future prospects for growth of the EGSS are strongly dependent on continuing ambitious renewable energy and green growth policies in Europe and how these impact on competition with the United States and China.   The overall increase in employment and value added in the EGSS sector is a positive development. However, a greener economy is not inclusive and socially sustainable by default, and the transition phase is likely to entail some challenges, particularly within certain sectors and certain types of jobs. Consequently, a comprehensive approach is needed that ensures that green jobs are also decent jobs that contribute to social inclusion (ILO, 2008).     Outlook beyond 2020   An expanding EGSS is a key factor in achieving low-carbon growth decoupled from resource use, as envisaged in the 7th EAP. Policies on energy efficiency and renewable energy (EC, 2015b) and waste recycling (EC, 2015c) cover a period beyond 2020, suggesting that there could be long-term growth in the EGSS. Further expansion of the EGSS could be assisted through ambitious renewable energy and green growth policies at the EU and national levels but also via more direct assistance such as investment support schemes that provide investors with a high degree of investment certainty.    About the indicator    This briefing uses data from the EGSS account, which is a module of the European environmentaleconomic accounts. Environmental accounts analyse the interaction between the economy and the environment by organising environmental information in a way that is consistent with national accounts. The EGSS is defined as that part of a countrys economy that is engaged in producing goods and services that are used in environmental protection activities and resource management either domestically or abroad. The income created by the EGSS is expressed in terms of gross value added (at 2010 prices), which is the difference between output and intermediate consumption. Employment in the EGSS is expressed in terms of full-time equivalent jobs.   The data are broken down by industry (e.g. services, construction, etc.); environmental protection class (e.g. wastewater management, waste management, protection of biodiversity and landscapes); and resource management class (e.g. water management, energy resource management). The EGSS does not cover a number of resource management economic activities, e.g. the management of forest resources, the management of wild flora and fauna and research and development on resource management.   European environmental accounts are established by Regulation (EU) No691/2011 on European environmental economic accounts. From 2017, reporting of data on the EGSS will be mandatory and standardised (Eurostat, 2015). Current data are a combination of Eurostat estimates with some Member State data reported through voluntary surveys. There are some comparability issues at country level in terms of coverage, time series availability and the use of different classifications or approaches for calculating employment data.

It is uncertain if emissions will reduce by 2020, since according to projections by the EU Member States emissions will remain more or less stable between 2015 and 2020             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016       Setting the scene    The 7th EAP calls for a reduction in the environmental impact of mobility (EU, 2013). Transport (i.e. mobility) is a major contributor to climate change, air pollution, noise, natural resource depletion and land fragmentation. Reducing the environmental impact of transport is usually done by reducing the demand for travel, introducing new, cleaner technologies and shifting towards less environmentally damaging transport modes. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector have been used in this briefing as a proxy indicator for the overall environmental impacts of the transport sector. These emissions reflect the level and efficiency of the sectors activity as well as the mix of transport modes. In addition, climate change (and therefore greenhouse gas emissions) is one of the most significant environmental issues, and transport contributes about one quarter of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions.   Policy targets and progress   In 2011, the European Commission published a White Paper on transport entitled Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area  Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system (EC, 2011). It acts as a framework to guide future policy developments in the transport sector over the next decade. The White Paper sets out 10 goals for a competitive and resource-efficient transport system, serving as benchmarks for achieving the target of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU transport sector by 2050 (from 1990 levels).   From 1990 to 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from transport increased by 20.1% compared with 1990 levels (see Figure 1). This increase comes despite improvements in the efficiency of transport and is in line with increases in the level of economic activity as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) as well as increases in demand for transport (both freight and passenger) (EEA, 2016a, 2016b).   Nevertheless, emissions decreased from 2008 to 2013, in part because of the lower levels of economic activity  manifesting also in lower levels of freight transport (EEA, 2016b)  following the 2008 economic downturn, as well as further implementation of transport efficiency measures.   Road transport accounts for 72% of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the sector (EEA, 2016c). Energy efficiency improvements in road transport played a key role in limiting the increase of road transport emissions. Such improvements were brought about in part by means of increasingly stringent technical standards, including the average CO 2  emission standards for new passenger cars (EU, 2009) and vans (EU, 2011). The increased use of less carbon-intensive fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biofuel blends, has also led to lower road transport emissions (EEA, 2015).   Figure 1. Greenhouse gas emissions from transport, EU        It is uncertain if transport greenhouse gas emissions will reduce by 2020, since according to projections by the EU Member States, emissions for the EU (including international aviation but excluding international shipping) will remain more or less stable between 2015 and 2020 in both scenarios: with existing measures and with additional measures (EEA, 2016d, 2016e). Preliminary estimates for 2015 emissions show, nevertheless, an increase of 2.3% above 2014 levels (EEA, 2016f).          Country level information     Figure 2. Change in greenhouse gas emissions from transport, 1990 to 2014, by country         Outlook beyond 2020   The 10 goals set by the European Commission White Paper on Transport (EC, 2011) are expected to lead to the future introduction of new EU policies to increase the efficiency of Europes transport sector. The main target of the White Paper is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% of 1990 levels by 2050. A key assumption in the White Paper is that technologies that contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions will be increasingly available, especially after 2030, such as the electrification of transport and more intensive use of advanced biofuels.   A modal shift away from road transport is also a key element of the EUs decarbonisation ambitions. The White Paper explicitly states the ambition to shift 30% of road transport for distances over 300km to rail and inland navigation by 2030, and more than 50% by 2050.   Nevertheless, total transport demand is predicted to continue growing during the 20202030 period in line with the 20102020 patterns (1% a year for passenger transport (passenger km) and 1.5% for freight transport (tonne km)) and at lower rates between 2030 and 2050 (0.7% a year for passenger transport and 0.8% for freight transport) (EC, 2016).   Integrated measures addressing both production and consumption would therefore be needed in the long run in order to, inter alia, contain the expected increase in transport demand and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 60% by 2050.   About the indicator   This indicator presents the total EU greenhouse gas emissions from transport including emissions from international aviation but excluding emissions from international maritime transport. Greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The individual gases were converted into greenhouse gas emissions by being weighted according to their global warming potentials following the relevant guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For further information on the indicator and on the method used, please see the indicator specification of the EEA indicator TERM (Transport and Environment Reporting Mechanism) 002 (EEA, 2016g).

Transport (i.e. mobility) is a major contributor to climate change, air pollution, noise, natural resource depletion and land fragmentation. Reducing the environmental impact of transport is usually done by reducing the demand for travel, introducing new, cleaner technologies and shifting towards less environmentally damaging transport modes. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector have been used in this briefing as a proxy indicator for the overall environmental impacts of the transport sector. These emissions reflect the level and efficiency of the sectors activity as well as the mix of transport modes. In addition, climate change (and therefore greenhouse gas emissions) is one of the most significant environmental issues, and transport contributes about one quarter of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <h2>Policy targets and progress</h2> <p>In 2011, the European Commission published a White Paper on transport entitled Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area  Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system (EC, 2011). It acts as a framework to guide future policy developments in the transport sector over the next decade. The White Paper sets out 10 goals for a competitive and resource-efficient transport system, serving as benchmarks for achieving the target of a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the EU transport sector by 2050 (from 1990 levels).</p> <p>From 1990 to 2014, greenhouse gas emissions from transport increased by 20.1% compared with 1990 levels (see Figure 1). This increase comes despite improvements in the efficiency of transport and is in line with increases in the level of economic activity as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) as well as increases in demand for transport (both freight and passenger) (EEA, 2016a, 2016b).</p> <p>Nevertheless, emissions decreased from 2008 to 2013, in part because of the lower levels of economic activity  manifesting also in lower levels of freight transport (EEA, 2016b)  following the 2008 economic downturn, as well as further implementation of transport efficiency measures.</p> <p>Road transport accounts for 72% of the total greenhouse gas emissions of the sector (EEA, 2016c). Energy efficiency improvements in road transport played a key role in limiting the increase of road transport emissions. Such improvements were brought about in part by means of increasingly stringent technical standards, including the average CO<sub>2</sub> emission standards for new passenger cars (EU, 2009) and vans (EU, 2011). The increased use of less carbon-intensive fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biofuel blends, has also led to lower road transport emissions (EEA, 2015).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 1.

This briefing focuses on housing aspects, while food ( AIRS_PO2.10, 2016 ) 1  and mobility ( AIRS_PO2.9 ) 2  are dealt with in two other related briefings. The construction and use of housing leads to a number of environmental impacts ranging from land takeand the consumption of resourcesto the production of waste during construction and demolition. The largest environmental impacts arguably result from energy consumption during the use phase.    Policy targets and progress   There is no environmental acquis equivalent to the 7thEAP selected objective. The key EU policies that influence household energy use are the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD; EU, 2010a), the Energy Labelling Directive (EU, 2010b), theEcodesign Directive (EU, 2009)and the Energy Efficiency Directive (EU, 2012).The EPBD requires Member States to set minimum energy performance standards for new buildings,to establish inspection schemes for heating and air conditioning systems or to put in place measureswith equivalent effect,and to display energyperformancecertificates in building sale or rental advertisements. The Directive alsorequires all new buildings to be near zero energy by 2020 (2018 for public buildings). The Energy Efficiency Directive requires countries to set indicative targets for energy consumption, pursue renovation of at least 3% of buildings owned and occupied bycentral government annually and draw up long-term plans for renovation strategies. The Energy Labelling Directive aims to encourageproducers and consumers to favour more energy-efficientappliances, whilethe Ecodesign Directivesetsminimum standards for a growing number of appliances and other energy-related products.    Figure 1 shows that the final energy consumption of households in the EUhas been declining since 2005.      Figure 1. Climate correctedfinal energy consumption in the households sector          Energy efficiency policies have led to reductions in energy consumption, while lifestyle changes have had the opposite effect. Energy efficiency improvements in space heating and the use of more efficient electrical appliances, as well as behavioural changes driven by higher energy prices and the 2008 economic downturn all contributed to reductions in overall energy consumption. An increase in the number of appliances, in the average size of dwellings, in the number of dwellingsand in the level of comfort partially offset efficiency improvements.   Approximately two thirdsof energy used byhouseholdsin Europe isfor space heating. Energy efficiency improvements for space heating occurred as a result of the improved energy performance of the building envelope and increased efficiency of the heating equipment.In 2013, a number of EU regulations on labelling and ecodesign for space heating equipment were introduced, and they are expected to result in further reductions in energy consumption in the residential sector and, consequently, areduction in the associated environmental impacts (JRC, 2016).   Improvements in the energy efficiency of large appliancesis driven by EU directives on mandatory energy labelling andecodesign. The proportion of the most efficient appliances (A+, A++ or, more recently, A+++) has increased significantly: from 10% in 2005 to 96% in 2014 for refrigerators, and from 16.5% to 90% for washing machines (EEA, 2016).   On 25 February 2015, the Commission adoptedA framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy (EC, 2015). The framework creates the momentum to bring about a transition to a low-carbon, secure and competitive energy system along five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions: security of supply, a fully integrated energy market, energy efficiency, climate change, and research and innovation.    Looking to the future, the energy efficiency targets set under the revised Energy Efficiency Directiveand Energy Union processshould help to keep the momentum towards increasing energy efficiencyand lead to further reductions inthe energy consumptionof households.   Country Level Information   Figure 2 shows the annual average energy household consumption per square metreforEU countries in 2005 compared with 2014. The datahave been corrected for annual variations in weather across all countries.   Energy use, measured in kilograms of oil equivalent (koe) persquare metre,differs widely betweencountries because of the stateand age of the building stock, the size of the dwelling, the heating/cooling systems used and energy efficiency measures. In 2014, energy consumption for space heating ranged fromless than10koe/m 2 in countries such as Spain, Bulgaria and Italy to more than 14koe/m 2  incountries such as Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Poland.    Figure 2. Climate corrected average energy consumption per dwelling in 2005 and 2014 in selected EU countries         Outlook beyond 2020    Energy use in households accounts for about one quarter of all the energy usedin the EU. Therefore reductions in household energy consumption are necessary if Europe is to achieve the low-carbon growth envisaged in the long-term vision of the 7th EAP.   Reducing energy consumption inexistingbuildings presents a major challenge to achieving this goal as the turnover of the building stock is slow and behavioural changes take time to implement on a large scale. Progress can be achieved bymaking better use of climate finance and revenues from energy taxation, for example to support large-scale renovation and local authorities, andby encouraging changes in consumers behaviour throughthe creation of framework conditions that can better enable the consumer to participate in the energymarket (OpenExp, 2016).   The recently launched Heating and Cooling Strategy (EC, 2016) should help reduce the energy consumption of households by promoting increased use ofdistrict heating and better integration of renewable energy sources.   About the indicator   Figure 1 represents final energy consumption by households. This is the total energy consumed each year by the household sector. It excludes energy lost in the production and transport of the energy to households, as well as the energy consumption of household members for transport. The data are corrected to account forannual variations in weather using heating degree-days for space heating. Figure 2 represents the energy consumption of households for space heating per square metre. The indicator is calculated as the ratio between final energy consumption of households for space heating corrected for annual variations in weather using heating degree-days across countries and the average size of dwellings in each Member State multiplied by the number of dwellings (ODYSSEE, 2016).,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Indicative outlook</strong><strong>of the EU meeting</strong><strong>the selected</strong><strong>objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Energy consumption by households</p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '><img alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></span></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '><span>Reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption in the housing sector</span> - 7th EAP</p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img alt='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' title='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5'> <p>The energy consumption of households in the EU decreased.

Air pollution is the number one environmental cause of death in the EU, responsible for more than 400000 premature deaths per year (EEA, 2016a). According to WHO studies (WHO, 2013, 2014), exposure to particulate matter (PM) can cause or aggravate cardiovascular and lung diseases, heart attacks and arrhythmias, affect the central nervous system and the reproductive system and cause cancer. Exposure to high ozone (O 3 ) concentrations can cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and cause lung diseases. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) increases symptoms of bronchitis in asthmatic children and reduces lung function growth. Health-related external costs range from EUR330 billion to EUR940 billion per year, depending on the valuation methodology, with evidence on the impacts of chronic ozone exposure adding around 5% to this total (EC, 2013).      Policy targets and progress   A chief cornerstone of the EU environmental acquis in the field of air quality is the Air Quality Directive (EU, 2008). This directive set a number of air quality standards not to be exceeded by a certain year and thereafter.   The communication on the Clean Air Programme for Europe (EC, 2013) sets the short-term objective of achieving full compliance with existing legislation by 2020 at the latest, as well as the long-term objective of seeing no exceedances of the WHO guideline levels for human health. The most troublesome pollutants in terms of harm to human health are particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and ground-level ozone (O 3 ). The European air quality standards and the WHO air quality guidelines (WHO, 2006) for these pollutants are displayed in Table 1.   Table 1. Air quality standards, under the EU Air Quality Directive, and WHO air quality guidelines          Notes:  1. (*) Not considered in the indicator, where only the most stringent EU standards are used: the daily limit value for PM 10  and the annual limit value for NO 2 . According to the WHO air quality guidelines, the annual average for PM takes precedence over the 24-hour average, since, at low levels, there is less concern about episodic excursions.  2. In line with the Air Quality Directive: limit value shall mean a level fixed on the basis of scientific knowledge, with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or the environment as a whole, to be attained within a given period and not to be exceeded once attained; target value shall mean a level fixed with the aim of avoiding, preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and/or the environment as a whole, to be attained where possible over a given period.   Source: EU, 2008; WHO, 2006.    Figures 1 and 2 show the percentage of the urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above both EU standards (Figure 1) and WHO guidelines (Figure 2).   Figure 1. EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above selected air quality standards of the EU Air Quality Directive        Figure 2.EU urban population exposed to air pollutant concentrations above WHO air quality guidelines          Around one sixth of Europeans currently living in urban areas are exposed to air pollutant levels exceeding some EU air quality standards. Moreover, up to 96% are exposed to levels of some air pollutants deemed damaging to health by the WHOs more stringent guidelines(EEA, 2016a).      Particulate matter (PM    )   Between 2006 and 2014, 8  17% of the EUs urban population is estimated to have been exposed to concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in excess of the EU target value set for the protection of human health (Figure 1).With respect to the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a much larger proportion of the urban population (85  97%) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. The time series are considered too short to draw any firm conclusions on changes over time.   Notwithstanding limitations in data coverage in the early 2000s, a significant proportion of the EU urban population (16  42%) was exposed to concentrations of coarse dust particles (PM 10 ) in excess of the EU daily limit value set for the protection of human health during the 20002014 period (Figure 1). A slightly decreasing tendency can be observed throughout the whole period.   For the more stringent WHO guideline value (Figure 2), a higher proportion of the urban population (50  92%) was exposed to concentrations above this threshold. Here, a decreasing tendency is also observed, as in the case of the EU limit value.   PM may be categorised as either primary (i.e. directly emitted to the atmosphere) or secondary (i.e. formed in the atmosphere from the so-called precursor gases).   Primary PM originates from both natural and anthropogenic sources. The main emitter sectors are commercial, institutional and household fuel combustion and industry. In third place, agriculture is listed for PM 10  and transport for PM 2.5 . All these sectors reduced their PM emissions in the EU in the 20002014 period, although higher relative reductions were observed for industry and transport and only small reductions were observed for the other two sectors.   With the exception of ammonia, the reductions in emissions of the other secondary PM precursors (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, and non-methane volatile organic compounds) were much larger than the reductions in primary PM from 2000 to 2014 in the EU.   However, the reductions in both primary PM and precursors have not led to equivalent drops in the concentrations of PM. This is due to the fact that, due to chemical reactions of the precursors to form secondary particles, the relationships between emissions and concentrations are not linear. It can also be explained by uncertainties in the reported emissions of primary PM from the commercial, institutional and household fuel combustion sector, by intercontinental transport of PM and its precursor gases from outside Europe, and by the contribution of natural sources to PM concentrations (EEA, 2016b).   The contributions of the different emission sources to ambient air concentrations depend not only on the amount of pollutant emitted, but also on proximity to source, emission conditions (such as height and temperature) and other factors, such as dispersion conditions and topography. Sectors with low emission heights, such as traffic and household fuel combustion, generally make a more significant contribution to surface concentrations than emissions from high stacks.   Ozone (O 3 )   Although reductions in European emissions of O 3  precursors have led to lower peak concentrations of O 3 , the current target value is frequently exceeded on more than 25 days a year. In the 20002014 period, between 8% (in 2014) and 55% (in 2003) of the urban population was exposed to concentrations above thetarget value (Figure 1). In the last 7 years, the proportion of the urban population exposed has not exceeded 20%, with no significant change over time.   In relation to the more stringent WHO guideline (Figure 2), the proportion of the population exposed to concentrations above the guideline value is as high as 94  99%, with no discernible change over time.   O 3  concentrations are determined by emissions of its precursors and by meteorological conditions: ozone is formed in sunny conditions with high temperatures. Apart from reductions in anthropogenic emissions of O 3  precursors, there have been increases in natural emissions and also in intercontinental transport of O 3  and its precursors. Additional factors are also likely to mask the effects of European measures to reduce anthropogenic emissions of O 3  precursors, including climate change, emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds from vegetation (difficult to quantify) and fire plumes from forest and other biomass fires (EEA, 2010). Formation of tropospheric ozone from increased concentrations of methane may also contribute to the sustained O 3  levels in Europe.   Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 )   Between 2000 and 2014, the fraction of the urban population exposed to concentrations in excess of the EU limit value and the identical WHO guideline value gradually decreased to around 10%, with a minimum of 7% in 2014 (Figures 1 and 2). The highest exposure of the urban population to NO 2 , 31%, occurred in 2003.   Enforcement of current legislation has resulted in a reduction in NO x  emissions in all sectors. Nevertheless, emissions from transport keep NO 2  concentrations high close to main roads.   Based on the current trends, explained above, and because of their high and widespread exceedances in urban areas, it is unlikely that air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020, while achieving air quality in line with the WHO guidelines is much further away. Effective air quality policies require action and cooperation on global, European, national and local levels, which must reach across most economic sectors and engage the public. Holistic solutions must be found that involve technological development, structural changes  including the optimisation of infrastructures and urban planning  and behavioural changes. These will be necessary to deliver a level of air quality across the EU that is conducive to the protection of human health (EEA, 2016b).   Country-level information   Table 2 provides information on the urban population exposed to concentrations of air pollutants above the EU air quality objectives by country for the year 2014. Variations from country to country are not only related to the different pollutant concentrations but also to:     the number of available data series (monitoring stations and/or selected cities), which will influence the total monitored population;   the uneven distribution of traffic and background stations in the different countries.        Table 2. Urban population exposed to concentrations of air pollutants above selected air quality standards of the Air Quality Directive, 2014          Note: NA = no available data, for further information please see indicator CSI004.  Source: Air pollution country fact sheets (EEA, 2014) updated with 2014 data. The 2014 data aggregated at EU level are also available (EEA, 2016a, 2016c).    Outlook beyond 2020   In 2013, the European Commission proposed a Clean Air Policy Package for Europe (EC, 2013), which aims to achieve full compliance with existing air quality legislation by 2020, and to further improve Europes air quality by 2030 and beyond. As a result of this package, it has recently been agreed to revise the 2001 National Emission Ceilings Directive (EU, 2001). The proposed new directive establishes new national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and stricter commitments from 2030 for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, non-methane volatile organic compounds, ammonia and PM 2.5 . In addition, and as part of the package, a new directive, the Medium Combustion Plant Directive, was approved in November 2015 (EU, 2015). This directive regulates sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust emissions from the combustion of fuels in medium-sized combustion plants (with a rated thermal input of 1and up to 50megawatt).   These new commitments, together with the on-going implementation of air quality improvement measures at national, regional and local levels, are expected to improve air quality in Europe. However, the changes in meteorological conditions due to climate change are expected to increase O 3  concentrations as a result of expected increased emissions of both specific O 3  precursors and emissions from wildfires; these can increase under periods of extensive drought (EEA, 2015).   Finally, it is expected that the age group composition of the EU population will continue to shift towards higher numbers of the elderly because of continuing increases in life expectancy (Eurostat, 2016). The overall potential air pollution-related health impact of this change remains uncertain.   About the indicator   This briefing shows the proportion of the EU urban population that is exposed to various potentially harmful concentrations of pollutants in excess of both EU standards and WHO guidelines set for the protection of human health. For further information on the methodology, please refer to the EEA indicator Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban populations (EEA, 2016a).   The indicator focuses on those pollutants that are most relevant in terms of health effects and urban concentrations: PM, both PM 10  and fine PM or PM 2.5 ; O 3 ; and NO 2 . When there is more than one standard, only the most stringent one is used. The indicator is based on measurements of air pollutants reported under the Air Quality Directive (EU 2008) and the Decisions on the exchange of information (EU, 2011).   Most air pollution is man-made and derives from combustion of fossil or biomass fuels used in industry, transport and heating; industrial and agricultural processes; and other sources (EEA, 2016b). As most of these sources, particularly emissions from cars, are concentrated in urban areas, where most of the European population lives, air quality in urban areas is a useful proxy for tracking progress towards meeting the standards set out in the Air Quality Directive.,<p class='image-inline'></p> <table class='plain' style='width: 900px;'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p><strong>EU indicator past trend</strong> <br /><br /></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='200'> <p>Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas<br />(nitrogen dioxide: NO<sub>2</sub>; coarse dust particles: PM<sub>10</sub>; ozone: O<sub>3</sub>;<span>fine particulate matter: PM</span><sub>2.5</sub><span>)</span></p> <p></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p align='center'><span><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/766e1dac-0343-4746-93f3-e171ba6c3320.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></span></p> <p align='center'><span>NO<sub>2</sub><span>, PM<sub>10</sub></span></span></p> <p align='center'><span><span><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/c0deea0d-40aa-4102-8916-867cdd2d7dde.jpeg' alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></span></span></p> <p align='center'><span>O<sub>3, </sub></span>PM<sub>2.5</sub><span></span></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Meet Air Quality Directive standards for the protection of human health  Air Quality Directive</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><em style='text-align: left; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='6'> <p><span>Despite reductions in concentrations in urban areas of coarse dust particles and nitrogen dioxide and no significant change in ozone and fine particulate matter, due to their high and widespread exceedance levels in urban areas it is unlikely that the air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) aims to significantly improve outdoor air quality and move closer to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (WHO, 2006) by 2020.

For further information on the methodology, please refer to the EEA indicator Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban populations (EEA, 2016a).</p> <p>The indicator focuses on those pollutants that are most relevant in terms of health effects and urban concentrations: PM, both PM<sub>10</sub> and fine PM or PM<sub>2.5</sub>; O<sub>3</sub>; and NO<sub>2</sub>. When there is more than one standard, only the most stringent one is used. The indicator is based on measurements of air pollutants reported under the Air Quality Directive (EU 2008) and the Decisions on the exchange of information (EU, 2011).</p> <p>Most air pollution is man-made and derives from combustion of fossil or biomass fuels used in industry, transport and heating; industrial and agricultural processes; and other sources (EEA, 2016b). As most of these sources, particularly emissions from cars, are concentrated in urban areas, where most of the European population lives, air quality in urban areas is a useful proxy for tracking progress towards meeting the standards set out in the Air Quality Directive.</p>","Outdoor air quality in urban areas",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes the objective of ensuring that outdoor air quality in the EU has significantly improved by 2020, moving closer to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Observing the existing EU air quality legislation standards is a chief milestone in this respect. Despite some improvements, due to the implementation of EU legislation on emissions of air pollutants and air quality, key EU air quality standards for the protection of human health  concentrations of particulate matter (PM), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)  are currently not being met in various air quality monitoring stations in the EU. This is particularly true for urban areas, where more than 70% of the EU population lives. This can be mainly attributed to the high level of emissions from road traffic and residential combustion in urban areas and unfavourable conditions for the dispersion of emissions due to topography and meteorological issues. Based on current trends and because of their high and widespread exceedances in urban areas, it is unlikely that the air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020, while achieving air quality in line with the WHO guidelines is much further away. Further action will be needed, in particular in relation to road traffic and residential combustion in urban areas.</p> <p><span><br /></span></p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-23T15:34:06Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Austria,Czech Republic,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Belgium,Lithuania,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",,"published","Air pollution,Environment and health","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/environment-and-health/outdoor-air-quality-urban-areas","Briefing (all)","2014,2003,2015,2004,2016,2005,2006,2017,2018,2007,2008,2019,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2001,2012,2013,2002","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

The major sources of pollution responsible for faecal bacteria are sewage and water draining from farms and farmland. Such pollution increases during heavy rain and floods, when pollution is washed into rivers and seas, and as a result of overflowing sewerage networks. In addition to good water quality for bathing, clean unpolluted water is required for our ecosystems and to support economic activities such as tourism.    Policy targets and progress    The efforts of the EU to ensure clean and healthy bathing waters started 40 years ago with the original Bathing Water Directive in 1976 (EU, 1976). This was followed by a revised Bathing Water Directive in 2006 (EU, 2006), which updated the measures of the 1976 legislation and simplified its management and surveillance methods. This revised Directive also provides for better and earlier public information about bathing water quality.   The Bathing Water Directive has the aim of increasing the number of bathing waters classified as excellent or good. It also includes a shorter term goal that, by 2015, all waters should have been of at least sufficient quality. In the context of this briefing, and with the aim of linking the objective of the 7th EAP regarding bathing water to the Bathing Water Directive, bathing waters that meet the minimum water quality standards of the Directive (meaning that they were of at least sufficient bathing water quality) are considered to have achieved the high standards called for under the 7th EAP.   Minimum water quality standards were met by 96.1% of all EU bathing waters identified for the 2015 bathing season, which represents an increase of 0.9 percentage points when compared with 2014. In total, 351 EU bathing waters had poor quality in 2015. The proportion of bathing waters with poor quality dropped to 1.6% in 2015. This represents a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared with the previous season (EEA, 2016).   Figure 1 provides an overview of the classification of EU bathing waters into the categories excellent, sufficient and poor, as well as those bathing waters that could not be classified, from 2011 to 2015.             Figure    1. Overall bathing water quality in the EU, 2011 to 2015           The share of bathing waters in the EU with excellent status increased from 78.1% in 2011 to 84.4% in 2015. The proportion of bathing waters with poor quality remained relatively constant (between 1.6% and 2.0%) during the 20112015 period (EEA, 2016).   Overall bathing water quality is thus improving over time. It is encouraging to observe that more and more bathing waters are not only reaching the minimum quality standards set by the Bathing Water Directive but are achieving the highest (excellent) quality standards. The outlook towards the 2020 goal is therefore positive.   Many years of investment in the sewerage system and better wastewater treatment, and the reduction of pollution from farms have led to Europes bathing waters being much cleaner today than they were 40 years ago. The implementation of the Urban Waste-water Treatment Directive (EU, 1991) and a focus on reducing overflow from sewers have been instrumental in reducing pollution and in improving the quality of several low-quality bathing waters (EEA, 2016). However, as figure 1 shows, there are still bathing waters with poor quality. The major sources of pollution responsible for faecal bacteria in bathing waters today are still insufficiently treated or untreated wastewater as a result of system failures, overflows from sewage treatment works or from scattered houses with misconnected drains and poorly located or poorly maintained septic tanks, poorly stored slurry or manure from livestock that washes into streams, and animal (mostly dog) and bird faeces on beaches or crowded beaches with many swimmers.   In wet summers, large amounts of rainwater affect bathing water quality by causing stormwater overflow andthe release of diluted sewage into bathing waters or streams discharging close to beaches. Rainwater also washes animal waste from urban and rural areas into surface water drains and rivers.   Poor water quality can also be caused by misconnected plumbing, whereby foul water such as that from bathrooms or from poorly maintained cesspits and septic tanks enters surface water drains. In years with below average sunshine, water quality is also affected, as the suns ultraviolet rays kill the faecal bacteria found in the water.   In the case of bathing waters with poor quality, it is imperative that the sources of pollution be assessed. The bathing water profiles prepared under the Bathing Water Directive should provide an indication of pollution sources in the catchment area of the bathing water and, together with historical data on rainfall, stream flow and sea currents, should provide information on the upstream sources of pollution to be targeted with measures. Management measures are primarily implemented for those bathing waters that have only sufficient or poor water quality.   The share of bathing waters that meet excellent and good quality standards is likely to increase due to the implementation of the Bathing Water Directive, in particular the effect of measures for poor quality waters.      Country-level information    Figure 2 provides  the results for bathing water quality in 2015 for the EU Member States and two other countries. In general, bathing water quality was of a high standard across the countries.    Figure 2. Bathing water quality for the EU-28, Albania and Switzerland          Note:   The category quality classification not possible includes waters for which there were not enough samples, new bathing waters, bathing waters with changes or bathing waters that had been closed.       All reported bathing water sites in Cyprus, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia achieved at least sufficient quality in 2015 (in accordance with the minimum quality standards set by the Bathing Water Directive). Moreover, in excess of 90% of bathing water sites were of excellent quality in eight Member States: Luxembourg (all 11 reported bathing water sites), Cyprus (99.1% of sites), Malta (97.7%), Greece (97.2%), Croatia (94.2%), Italy (90.5%), Germany (90.3%) and Austria (90.2%).   In 2015, there were 383 sites with poor quality bathing water in Europe. Italy (95 bathing water sites or 1.7%), France (95 sites or 2.8%) and Spain (58 sites or 2.6%) were the countries with the highest number of poor bathing water sites.   In some EU Member States, more than 3% of the bathing water sites had poor quality: 4.9% or 31 bathing water sites in the United Kingdom, 4.4% or six sites in Ireland, 3.4% or 24 sites in the Netherlands and 3.2% or three sites in Bulgaria (EEA, 2016).   Outlook beyond 2020   Bathing water quality is not only essential for public health reasons, but clean unpolluted water is also necessary to improve ecosystem resilience. Both can be achieved with more integrated and sustainable water resource management. This would require more robust implementation of the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000), with River Basin Management Plans developed to improve the poorer quality bathing waters. This would serve to maintain the trend towards consistently high-quality EU bathing waters beyond 2020.   About the indicator   This indicator provides an overview of the bathing water quality in 2015 at more than 21000 bathing waters in the Member States of the EU. It also presents the evolution of bathing water quality from 2011 to 2015. During the bathing season, samples from coastal and inland bathing waters are taken and analysed against two microbiological parameters that may indicate the presence of faecal pollution, namely intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli(also known as E. coli). After the end of the bathing season, and based on 4 years of data, bathing waters are classified into one of the bathing water quality classes (excellent, good, sufficient or poor). Some bathing waters have not been classified because there were insufficient samples or because they are new or have undergone changes affecting water quality.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>EU indicator past trend</strong> <br /><br /></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: left; '><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; ' width='121'> <p style='text-align: left; '><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p style='text-align: left; '>Bathing water quality</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Increase the number of bathing waters classified as 'excellent' or 'good' under the Bathing Water Directive</p> </td> <td> <p><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' style='margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block; ' title='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' alt='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>The share of bathing waters that meet excellent and good quality standards are likely to increase further due to implementation of the Bathing Water Directive, in particular the effect of measures on poor quality waters</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <div class='pageBreak'></div> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes an objective that, by 2020, citizens throughout the EU will benefit from high standards of bathing water.Bathing water quality is a cause for concern for public health, as swimming at beaches or bathing lakes contaminated with faecal bacteriacan result in illness.

"forest-utilisation  Forest utilisation  forest           Indicator       EU indicator past trend       Selected objective  to be met by 2020       Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by2020           Forest: growing stock, increment and fellings               Forest management is sustainable   7th EAP (focus solely on forest utilisation)                            Since 1990, EU forests overall have been harvested at a lower rate than they have grown (at around 60  70%), indicating sustainable forest management in relation to the forest utilisation rate. Despite expected increased harvesting of forests, the overall forest utilisation is expected to remain sustainable up to 2020             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP sets out to ensure that forest management is sustainable by 2020 (EU, 2013). Sustainable forest management means using forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems (EC, 2013). Forests are essential natural resources hosting a major part of the biodiversity in Europe. Forests also sequester and store carbon, filter water and provide recreational opportunities. This briefing focuses on one aspect of sustainable forest management, namely forest resources, in terms of how the forest utilisation rate affects the forest growing stock. This is used as a measure of the sustainability of the production and use of forest resources and thus the pressure from society and human demand for wood. The utilisation rate  does not reflect  the structures and processes  necessary to maintain biodiversity  and the various forest ecosystem services.   Policy targets and progress     The environmental acquis does not include a specific target addressing sustainable forest management and the EU does not have a common forest policy. Forest sustainability and environmental issues are, nevertheless, embedded in almost all the nature and environmental policies of the EU. The EU Forest Strategy (EC, 2013) aims to coordinate these forest-related policies and to identify the key principles that are needed to ensure the sustainability and multifunctionality of forests in Europe. The strategy will be reviewed in 2018 in order to assess progress in its implementation.   Figure 1 shows that the forest utilisation rate (the ratio between the felling of trees and their annual growth) for the EU has remained relatively constant during the period examined (19902010). On average, the indicator stayed well below 100 %, varying between 60 % and 68 % (Forest Europe, 2015; EEA, 2016).       Figure 1.  Forest utilisation rate, EU         The forest utilisation rate reflects the development of felling as well as the development of annual increment. Both components of the indicator have increased over the period examined (Forest Europe, 2015; EEA, 2016). The demand for wood has been increasing. The forest area in the EU has increased by 13millionha since 1990 (8%). The growing stock has also expanded by 7.4millionm 3  (38%) over the period examined. This increase in growing stock is not only linked to the increase in forest area but also to a number of other reasons across the EU, in particular increased growth rates, low levels of harvesting and increased focus on multifunctional use of forests (ecosystem services from forests).   The expected trend in the EU is an overall increased use of renewable materials and energy as well as the use of forests to provide other ecosystem services. This may mean use of more wood extracted from forests in the EU. Views on the use of wood as renewable biomass are under revision, as the carbon neutrality as well as the resource efficiency of such a use of wood have been questioned. The forest area is expected to remain stable or slightly increase. The growing stock is also expected to stay relatively stable overall, but with regional differences. The expected trend by 2020 may be a slight short- to medium-term increase in the forest utilisation rate indicator to meet increased demands and due to the maturing age structure of forests in Europe. Overall, despite expected increased harvesting of forests, overall forest utilisation is expected to remain less than 100%, so it is considered sustainable.   Country level information     Twenty-two EU countries reported on their forest utilisation rates in the 19902010 period (Forest Europe, 2015). The information underpinning this indicator has not been updated since 2010. In most countries that reported their forest utilisation rate, it remained below 100% for the 19902010 period (Figure 2).   Forest utilisation rates vary widely across the countries and over time, from 25% to more than 100%. Some countries have experienced severe storms in recent decades, which caused large natural losses as well as reductions in increment. This partly explains some of the high utilisation rates of some countries.   It should be stressed that medium- or short-term exceedance of the forest utilisation rate does not necessarily mean that the use of forest resources is unsustainable, as it may reflect harvesting of mature stands or severe storms, for example. From a sustainable forest management perspective, it is the long-term utilisation rate of forests that should stay below 100%.       Figure 2. Forest utilisation rates       Outlook beyond 2020   The outlook for the forest utilisation rate indicator will depend on the demand for biomass as a renewable energy source (UNECE and FAO, 2011). Biomass demand is expected to increase beyond 2020 as part of the EUs efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050 (EC, 2011) and in line with the 7th EAPs 2050 low-carbon economy vision. An increased demand for biomass could increase the demand for wood and with this the utilisation rate unless the annual increment also increases (Berndes et al., 2016).   However, some stakeholders consider that the use of wood directly from the forest for renewable energy may not be resource efficient (Berndes et al., 2016). Forest industries are concerned about whether or not the demand for other forest products and resources can be met. Nevertheless, the majority of wood biomass comes from residue feedstocks in a cascading use of wood. The use of wood is likely to be even more resource efficient if considered as a component of a circular economy. Such resource efficiency might also have an impact on the amount of harvested wood needed to meet societys needs for timber and fuel (Berndes et al., 2016).   Climate change is also a factor that will affect the composition and distribution of current forest resources. Desertification is expected to spread in the south of Europe while forest cover is projected to increase with higher altitudes and latitudes. The resulting impact of climate change on forest utilisation rates has not been explored.   Overall, the expected outlook is an increased forest utilisation rate; however, it is not expected to increase beyond 100% in the long term.          About the indicator        The forest utilisation rate is the ratio between the annual volume felled and the volume of annual growth in the stock of living trees. The ratio is used widely to assess the current and future availability of wood. A ratio below 100% indicates that the growing stock, the timber reserve, is stable. In the long term, the volume felled must not exceed the volume of growth. However, the indicator needs cautious interpretation, as it depends directly on the volume of annual growth. Average annual increment is calculated as the increase in growing stock volume over a year. An increase in growing stock results from maturing forests and an increase in forest area. The correct assessment of the volume of growing stock in Europe should be based on additional information on diameter class distribution, which is not available at European level.   The forest utilisation rate indicator only partly describes sustainable forest management. The indicator indirectly relates to an increased stock of carbon in forest biomass, which is a service provided by forests that mitigates climate change. The indicator has no link to biodiversity or forest condition, as it does not indicate whether or not biodiversity and other services are protected or maintained. Aspects of forest biodiversity are included in the EU protected species briefing ( AIRS_PO1.7, 2016 ), 1  the EU protected habitats briefing ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ) 2  and the Common birds and butterflies briefing ( AIRS_PO1.6, 2016 ). 3,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>EU indicator</strong><br /><strong>past trend</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Selected objective <br />to be met by 2020</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Indicative outlook<br />of the EU meeting<br />the selected<br />objective by2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Forest: growing stock, increment and fellings</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></em></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Forest management is sustainable <br /> 7th EAP (focus solely on forest utilisation)<em><span><span><span><span><br /></span></span></span></span></em></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' alt='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>Since 1990, EU forests overall have been harvested at a lower rate than they have grown (at around 60  70%), indicating sustainable forest management in relation to the forest utilisation rate.

Sustainable forest management means using forests and forest land in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems (EC, 2013). Forests are essential natural resources hosting a major part of the biodiversity in Europe. Forests also sequester and store carbon, filter water and provide recreational opportunities. This briefing focuses on one aspect of sustainable forest management, namely forest resources, in terms of how the forest utilisation rate affects the forest growing stock. This is used as a measure of the sustainability of the production and use of forest resources and thus the pressure from society and human demand for wood. The utilisation rate <span class='annotator-hl'>does not reflect</span> the structures and processes <span class='annotator-hl'>necessary to maintain biodiversity</span> and the various forest ecosystem services.</p> <h2>Policy targets and progress<span></span></h2> <p>The environmental acquis does not include a specific target addressing sustainable forest management and the EU does not have a common forest policy. Forest sustainability and environmental issues are, nevertheless, embedded in almost all the nature and environmental policies of the EU. The EU Forest Strategy (EC, 2013) aims to coordinate these forest-related policies and to identify the key principles that are needed to ensure the sustainability and multifunctionality of forests in Europe. The strategy will be reviewed in 2018 in order to assess progress in its implementation.</p> <p>Figure 1 shows that the forest utilisation rate (the ratio between the felling of trees and their annual growth) for the EU has remained relatively constant during the period examined (19902010). On average, the indicator stayed well below 100 %, varying between 60 % and 68 % (Forest Europe, 2015; EEA, 2016).</p> <div class='pageBreak'><b><br /></b></div> <h4 class='figureHeading'><b>Figure 1. <span><strong>Forest utilisation rate, EU</strong></span></b></h4> <p><iframe height='462' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/data-visualization-39/embed-chart?chart=chart_1&amp;chartWidth=599&amp;chartHeight=354&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7Ddiv%5Bid*%3D%22googlechart_wm_%22%5D%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;padding=11%2C27%2C41%2C63' width='584'></iframe></p> <p>The forest utilisation rate reflects the development of felling as well as the development of annual increment. Both components of the indicator have increased over the period examined (Forest Europe, 2015; EEA, 2016). The demand for wood has been increasing. The forest area in the EU has increased by 13millionha since 1990 (8%). The growing stock has also expanded by 7.4millionm<sup>3</sup> (38%) over the period examined. This increase in growing stock is not only linked to the increase in forest area but also to a number of other reasons across the EU, in particular increased growth rates, low levels of harvesting and increased focus on multifunctional use of forests (ecosystem services from forests).</p> <p>The expected trend in the EU is an overall increased use of renewable materials and energy as well as the use of forests to provide other ecosystem services. This may mean use of more wood extracted from forests in the EU. Views on the use of wood as renewable biomass are under revision, as the carbon neutrality as well as the resource efficiency of such a use of wood have been questioned. The forest area is expected to remain stable or slightly increase. The growing stock is also expected to stay relatively stable overall, but with regional differences. The expected trend by 2020 may be a slight short- to medium-term increase in the forest utilisation rate indicator to meet increased demands and due to the maturing age structure of forests in Europe. Overall, despite expected increased harvesting of forests, overall forest utilisation is expected to remain less than 100%, so it is considered sustainable.</p> <h2>Country level information</h2> <div> <p>Twenty-two EU countries reported on their forest utilisation rates in the 19902010 period (Forest Europe, 2015). The information underpinning this indicator has not been updated since 2010. In most countries that reported their forest utilisation rate, it remained below 100% for the 19902010 period (Figure 2).</p> <p>Forest utilisation rates vary widely across the countries and over time, from 25% to more than 100%. Some countries have experienced severe storms in recent decades, which caused large natural losses as well as reductions in increment. This partly explains some of the high utilisation rates of some countries.</p> <p>It should be stressed that medium- or short-term exceedance of the forest utilisation rate does not necessarily mean that the use of forest resources is unsustainable, as it may reflect harvesting of mature stands or severe storms, for example. From a sustainable forest management perspective, it is the long-term utilisation rate of forests that should stay below 100%.</p> <div class='pageBreak'><b><br /></b></div> <h4 class='figureHeading'><b>Figure 2. <strong>Forest utilisation rates</strong></b></h4> <iframe height='875' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/forest-utilisation-rate/embed-chart?chart=chart_1&amp;chartWidth=559&amp;chartHeight=749&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7Ddiv%5Bid*%3D%22googlechart_wm_%22%5D%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;padding=3%2C17%2C89%2C130' width='588'></iframe></div> <h2 class='figureHeading'>Outlook beyond 2020</h2> <p>The outlook for the forest utilisation rate indicator will depend on the demand for biomass as a renewable energy source (UNECE and FAO, 2011). Biomass demand is expected to increase beyond 2020 as part of the EUs efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050 (EC, 2011) and in line with the 7th EAPs 2050 low-carbon economy vision.

Since 1990, the utilisation rate has remained around 60  70% for the EU.

However, the target is some way off for others             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP states that, by 2020, waste should be safely managed as a resource, landfilling [is] limited to residual (i.e. non-recyclable and non-recoverable waste) and energy recovery [is] limited to non-recyclable materials (EU, 2013). The overarching logic guiding EU policy on waste is the waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste prevention, followed by preparation for reuse, recycling, other recovery and finally disposal, including landfilling as the least desirable option. This briefing presents trends on recycling of municipal waste. An improvement in the proportion of waste that is recycled indicates that waste management is moving up the waste hierarchy. Recycling allows the generation of more value from resources and creates jobs. It can also reduce the demand for raw materials and environmental impacts associated with meeting this demand ( AIRS_PO2.1, 2016 ). 1     Policy targets and progress    The EU has introduced multiple waste policies and targets since the 1990s. These include strategies, such as the Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste (EU, 2005),and framework legislation such as the Waste Framework Directive (EU, 2008). The Waste Framework Directive sets a target for 50% of at least four fractions (i.e. paper, glass, metals, plastics) of municipal waste to be prepared for reuse or recycled by 2020 in EU Member States. Countries can choose from four alternative calculation methods to measure progress towards the target.   In December 2015, the European Commission published Closing the loop  An EU action plan for the circular economy (EC, 2015), also known as the Circular Economy Package. The package sets out a large number of initiatives, and proposes new targets for municipal waste of 60% recycling and preparing for reuse by 2025 and 65% by 2030. These are based on only one calculation method (the one used in Figure 2 of this briefing) with the option of derogations on the timescale for some countries.   As can be seen in Figure 1, for the EU-28 the overall rate of recycling (material recycling, composting and digestion) increased from 30% in 2004 to 43% in 2014. This improvement is a combination of a reduction in the amount of municipal waste generated and an increase in the total quantity undergoing material recycling, composting and digestion. This increase is viewed as one of the success stories of environmental policy in Europe so far.    Figure 1. Proportion of municipal waste treated by different methods, EU         Figure 1 shows the trend in municipal waste recycling in the context of other municipal waste treatment methods. It is apparent that, as a whole, the EU is moving away from landfilling but that incineration is also growing, with a 44% increase between 2004 and 2014, compared with a 37% increase for recycling (including composting and digestion).   Country level information   Despite high (and sustained) levels of municipal waste recycling in some countries and strong improvement in many others, the low rates of recycling and slow progress made in some countries suggest that not everycountrywillachievethe Waste Framework Directive targetby2020.      Figure 2. Municipal waste recycling rate (including composting and digestion) by country          EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 34% in 2014, compared with 24% in 2004. In the EU-27, it increased from 31% to 44% over the same period. There were large differences in performance among those countries with the highest and lowest recycling rates. Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste in 2014. The highest increase in recycling rates between 2004 and 2014 occurred in Lithuania, Iceland, Poland, Italy, Cyprus, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic (increases of 2029 percentage points). Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over this period.However, in six countries the proportion of recycled municipal waste barely changed (Spain, Belgium, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Malta and Switzerland (increases of fewer than 5 percentage points) and in three countries (Finland, Austria and Turkey) it decreased.    The recycling rates shown in Figure 2 cannot be used to assess EU Member States progress against the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling set by the Waste Framework Directive, because Member States can choose between four different methods to calculate compliance with the target. Figure 2 shows recycling rates calculated following the most demanding method, i.e. method 4.   Progress in enhancing recycling rates is primarily due to trends in the recycling of materials, with biowaste recycling performing less well. Nineteen countries achieved fairly substantial increases in their material recycling rates, but there was comparatively little change in national biowaste recycling rates (EEA, 2013).   There is a clear link between increasing recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling. In countries with high municipal waste recycling rates, landfilling is declining much faster than recycling is growing, as waste management strategies usually move from landfilling towards a combination of recycling and incineration, and in some cases also mechanicalbiological treatment (MBT) (EEA, 2013).   Almost without exception, the countries that are performing better in terms of recycling have a wider range of measures and instruments in place than the poorer performing countries (EEA, 2013). Measures have included landfill bans on biodegradable waste or non-pre-treated municipal waste; mandatory separate collection of municipal waste types, especially biowastes; and economic instruments such as landfill and incineration taxes and waste collection fees that strongly encourage recycling. Producer responsibility, binding recycling targets and obligations to make separate collections have certainly also played a role. Although the key drivers behind better municipal waste management are clearly EU and national policies and targets, regional and local policies within countries also play a significant role (EEA, 2015).   Outlook beyond 2020   The 7th EAP describes a number of steps that are required to achieve its objective of waste being managed as a resource.The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015), includes a number of proposed targets and measures beyond 2020, which can move the EU towards this vision:     a common EU target of preparing 65% of municipal waste for reuse and recycling by 2030;   a common EU target of preparing 75% of packaging waste for reuse and recycling by 2030;   a binding landfill target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 2030;   a ban on landfilling of separately collected waste;   the promotion of economic instruments to discourage landfilling ;   simplified and improved definitions and harmonised calculation methods for recycling rates throughout the EU;   concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis  turning one industrys by-product into anothers raw material;   economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electrical and electronicequipment and vehicles).     The success of these targets and measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for achieving an innovative circular economy in which nothing is wasted, as envisaged by the 7th EAP.   About the indicator   This briefing focuses on the recycling of municipal waste. Despite the fact that it represents only around 7  10% of total waste generation in the EU, municipal waste is very visible and its prevention has the potential to reduce environmental impact, not only in the consumption and waste phases but also over the whole life cycle of the products consumed. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, but it may also include similar wastes generated by small businesses and public institutions that are also collected by municipalities.   Recycling of waste is defined as any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances, whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material (e.g. by composting or digesting) but does not include energy recovery and reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations (Eurostat, 2015).   The recycling rate is calculated as the percentage of municipal waste generated that is subsequently recycled (including composting and digesting). There are limitations in the comparability of data between countries and over time. There are also variations in what countries classify as municipal waste and, in some cases, these definitions have changed over time. In addition, there is also variation in the calculation method, depending on whether or not the weight of material collected but discarded during the recycling process is included.   Finally, the indicator shows the recycling rate of municipal waste calculated using a consistent method, although Member States can choose between four different methods to monitorrecyclingrates in order to meet the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling (EEA, 2015).,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2'> <p><b>Indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Recycling of municipal waste<em><br /></em></p> </td> <td width='42px'> <p align='center'><strong>EU</strong></p> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/766e1dac-0343-4746-93f3-e171ba6c3320.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><strong>EEA</strong></p> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/766e1dac-0343-4746-93f3-e171ba6c3320.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> </td> <td> <p>50 % of selected materials in household and similar waste to be recycled by each EU Member State  Waste Framework Directive</p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><br /></em></p> <p style='text-align: center; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/da466c84-2e67-4e97-83a1-3a87190ae755.jpeg' alt='Stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow circle: it is uncertain whether or not the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5'> <p>The amount of municipal waste being recycled has been steadily increasing.

In the EU-27, it increased from 31% to 44% over the same period. There were large differences in performance among those countries with the highest and lowest recycling rates. Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste in 2014. The highest increase in recycling rates between 2004 and 2014 occurred in Lithuania, Iceland, Poland, Italy, Cyprus, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic (increases of 2029 percentage points). Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over this period.However, in six countries the proportion of recycled municipal waste barely changed (Spain, Belgium, Latvia, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Malta and Switzerland (increases of fewer than 5 percentage points) and in three countries (Finland, Austria and Turkey) it decreased.</span></p> <p>The recycling rates shown in Figure 2 cannot be used to assess EU Member States progress against the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling set by the Waste Framework Directive, because Member States can choose between four different methods to calculate compliance with the target. Figure 2 shows recycling rates calculated following the most demanding method, i.e. method 4.</p> <p>Progress in enhancing recycling rates is primarily due to trends in the recycling of materials, with biowaste recycling performing less well. Nineteen countries achieved fairly substantial increases in their material recycling rates, but there was comparatively little change in national biowaste recycling rates (EEA, 2013).</p> <p>There is a clear link between increasing recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling. In countries with high municipal waste recycling rates, landfilling is declining much faster than recycling is growing, as waste management strategies usually move from landfilling towards a combination of recycling and incineration, and in some cases also mechanicalbiological treatment (MBT) (EEA, 2013).</p> <p>Almost without exception, the countries that are performing better in terms of recycling have a wider range of measures and instruments in place than the poorer performing countries (EEA, 2013). Measures have included landfill bans on biodegradable waste or non-pre-treated municipal waste; mandatory separate collection of municipal waste types, especially biowastes; and economic instruments such as landfill and incineration taxes and waste collection fees that strongly encourage recycling. Producer responsibility, binding recycling targets and obligations to make separate collections have certainly also played a role. Although the key drivers behind better municipal waste management are clearly EU and national policies and targets, regional and local policies within countries also play a significant role (EEA, 2015).</p> <h2>Outlook beyond 2020</h2> <p>The 7th EAP describes a number of steps that are required to achieve its objective of waste being managed as a resource.The Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015), includes a number of proposed targets and measures beyond 2020, which can move the EU towards this vision:</p> <ul> <li>a common EU target of preparing 65% of municipal waste for reuse and recycling by 2030;</li> <li>a common EU target of preparing 75% of packaging waste for reuse and recycling by 2030;</li> <li>a binding landfill target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 2030;</li> <li>a ban on landfilling of separately collected waste;</li> <li>the promotion of economic instruments to discourage landfilling ;</li> <li>simplified and improved definitions and harmonised calculation methods for recycling rates throughout the EU;</li> <li>concrete measures to promote reuse and stimulate industrial symbiosis  turning one industrys by-product into anothers raw material;</li> <li>economic incentives for producers to put greener products on the market and support recovery and recycling schemes (e.g. for packaging, batteries, electrical and electronicequipment and vehicles).</li> </ul> <p>The success of these targets and measures will be key to the medium- to long-term prospects for achieving an innovative circular economy in which nothing is wasted, as envisaged by the 7th EAP.</p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>This briefing focuses on the recycling of municipal waste. Despite the fact that it represents only around 7  10% of total waste generation in the EU, municipal waste is very visible and its prevention has the potential to reduce environmental impact, not only in the consumption and waste phases but also over the whole life cycle of the products consumed. Municipal waste consists to a large extent of waste generated by households, but it may also include similar wastes generated by small businesses and public institutions that are also collected by municipalities.</p> <p>Recycling of waste is defined as any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances, whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material (e.g. by composting or digesting) but does not include energy recovery and reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations (Eurostat, 2015).</p> <p>The recycling rate is calculated as the percentage of municipal waste generated that is subsequently recycled (including composting and digesting). There are limitations in the comparability of data between countries and over time. There are also variations in what countries classify as municipal waste and, in some cases, these definitions have changed over time. In addition, there is also variation in the calculation method, depending on whether or not the weight of material collected but discarded during the recycling process is included.</p> <p>Finally, the indicator shows the recycling rate of municipal waste calculated using a consistent method, although Member States can choose between four different methods to monitorrecyclingrates in order to meet the target of 50% of waste to be prepared for reuse and recycling (EEA, 2015).</p>","Recycling of municipal waste",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) contains the objective that waste is safely managed as a resource. This should help Europe to extract more value from the resources it uses, reduce environmental impacts associated with waste management and create jobs. Further increasing recycling rates of municipal waste (household and similar waste from other sources) is an important step in this regard.</p> <p>The amount of municipal waste being recycled has been steadily increasing in Europe, thanks to investments in appropriate collection and handling, financial incentives to move away from landfilling of waste and landfill bans. The performance of EU Member States on the recycling of municipal waste varies, although the comparability of data is hindered by variation in data collection and definitions. Despite a strong performance from some countries and clear progress being made in nearly all since 2004, in a number of Member States significant efforts are still needed to achieve the 2020 target.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-27T12:20:24Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Liechtenstein,Cyprus,Czech Republic,Austria,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Norway,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Lithuania,Belgium,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Resource efficiency and waste","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/recycling-of-municipal-waste","Briefing (all)","2014,2003,2004,2015,2016,2005,2017,2006,2018,2007,2008,2019,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2001,2012,2013,2002","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

Under the Regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, chemicals are classified as hazardous on the basis of properties that generate physical, environmental and health hazards (EU, 2008). While the production and subsequent use of chemicals provides benefits to society, exposure to the hazardous chemicals emitted along the chemical life cycle generates significant risks to health and ecosystems. Human exposure to chemicals is associated with a number of disease outcomes (Prss-Ustn et al., 2011), while chemical pollution degrades air and water quality and can impact negatively on ecosystem services. Hazardous chemicals have been detected in human populations and linked to environmental and dietary exposures (Smolders et al., 2015). Emerging concerns include the health impacts of chemical mixtures, endocrine-disrupting substances and nanomaterials (EEA and JRC, 2013).   Policy targets and progress   The Regulation on the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) (EU, 2006) aims to improve the protection of human health and the environment from the risks posed by chemicals. REACH also calls for the progressive substitution of the most hazardous chemicals, when suitable alternatives have been identified.   Eurostat developed a set of indicators to monitor progress towards two major goals of REACH: to improve the quality of data for chemical risk assessment, and to reduce the risks posed by chemicals to humans and the environment (Eurostat, 2009). An analysis using these indicators suggests that REACH implementation resulted in better risk control from 2007 to 2011 (Eurostat, 2012).   In making the link between the production of chemicals that are hazardous to human health and resulting risks to human health, the assumption is that reduced production volumes will equate to a reduction in the overall risk profile of chemicals incorporated into products and sold in the EU. The production of chemicals that are hazardous to health in the EU followed a gradual downward trend from 2005 to 2014, with an overall decline of 28 million tonnes in 2014, representing a 12 % drop from 2005 production levels. Within this period, production fell sharply during the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, and rebounded in 2010, to then decline again more gradually.   Figure 1 provides an overview of the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health by hazard class in the EU from 2005 to 2014, as well as showing total chemical production. The proportion of total EU chemical production that comprises chemicals that are hazardous to human health also followed a gradual downward trend over the 10 years, declining from 66 % in 2005 to 63 % in 2014. The proportion of chemicals that are carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction in total EU-28 chemical production declined from 11 % in 2005 to 10 % in 2014. Such chemicals are considered to pose the most significant risks to human health. These trends may be indicative of a shift in production towards less hazardous chemicals, driven by substitution.    Figure 1. Production of chemicals, by hazard class in the EU-28         However, production volumes for chemicals that are hazardous to health do not provide direct insight into risks, since production is not synonymous with exposure. On the one hand, some chemicals are handled in closed systems, or as intermediate goods in controlled supply chains, implying that no or limited exposure takes place (Eurostat, 2014). On the other hand, it is also possible that reductions in EU production of chemicals that are hazardous to health are being offset by increased imports of products that contain such chemicals, potentially leading to exposures along the product life cycle. In addition, the EU is a net importer of chemicals and in 2015 the volume of chemicals hazardous to health that was consumed in the EU was 7 % higher than the volume produced. EU chemical consumption also saw a downward trend from 2005 to 2014. However, while EU production of chemicals that are hazardous to health declined by 12 % between 2005 and 2014, consumption declined by only 9 % (Eurostat, 2016a).   These factors confound the use of EU production volumes of chemicals that are hazardous to health as a proxy for exposure. It is therefore not possible to accurately report progress towards the goal of minimising risks to the environment and health on the basis of this indicator.   Additional concerns focus on the health impacts of chemicals that affect the human hormone system (known as endocrine disruptors), risks to childrens health, nanomaterials and chemical combination effects. The 7th EAP calls for these aspects to be effectively addressed in EU legislation by 2020. The indicator on the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health does not provide specific insight on these concerns.   Outlook beyond 2020   Chemical risk is an area characterised by uncertainties regarding exposure levels, as well as associations between exposure and health outcomes and the causal mechanisms involved. New initiatives to generate data on the exposure of the European population to chemicals using human biomonitoring should serve to improve the knowledge base. This would provide a valuable evidence base for strengthening the protection of human health from chemical risks.   The 7th EAP calls for the development of an EU strategy for a non-toxic environment by 2018, to address the concerns listed above, as well as exposure to chemicals in products, including imported products, with a view to promoting non-toxic material cycles and reducing indoor exposure to harmful substances. This strategy is expected to set a framework for actions to minimise chemical risks beyond 2020.   Current efforts to promote a circular economy also have implications for chemicals in products. The reuse or recycling of products that are contaminated with hazardous chemicals may lead to unforeseen exposures of both humans and the environment. Further research is required to identify those material flows that are likely to be contaminated with hazardous chemicals and to understand the potential exposures that might arise from recycling these materials. Such knowledge might then inform decisions on whether to prioritise increasing the quantity of materials channelled for recycling, or to separate out contaminated materials for management as hazardous waste, so guaranteeing the quality of recycled materials.   At the United Nations level, in 2002, participants at the World Summit of Sustainable Development, including the EU and its Member States, made a commitment to the sound management of chemicals throughout their life cycle, aiming to achieve, by 2020, that chemicals are used and produced in ways that lead to the minimization of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment (UN, 2002). This goal was reaffirmed at Rio+20 (UN, 2012), with the 7th EAP explicitly calling for action to attain this goal at EU level. In addition, the Sustainable Development Goals (UN, 2015) set a global agenda until 2030 and define the risks from chemicals under several topics, including goals to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.   About the indicator   The indicator tracks the production of industrial chemicals that are hazardous to human health. It is restricted to chemicals under five toxicity classes, including, and beginning with the most dangerous: chemicals that are carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxicants; chemicals suspected to be carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxicants as well as skin and respiratory sensitisers (collectively called chronic toxic chemicals); very toxic chemicals; toxic chemicals; and harmful chemicals (Eurostat, 2016b). Collectively these classes comprise those chemicals deemed hazardous to health. These classes of chemicals exhibit properties that impact on human health, and are derived from the hazard statements described under the Regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures (EU, 2008).   The scope of the indicator is limited, since it does not cover all possible impacts on human health, nor does it cover chemicals that impact only on the environment. Taking the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health as an imperfect proxy for exposure, a fall in production may imply a reduction in exposure. However, there are a number of limitations when extrapolating exposure from production. First, exposure depends upon the uses to which synthesised chemicals are put and on safety measures in place to control emissions along the chemical life cycle, including production, use in products, waste and any recycling and/or reuse stages. Second, total production in the EU does not fully reflect total volume of chemicals incorporated into products and sold on the EU market, since it does not account for imports of chemicals and products containing chemicals.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>EU indicator past trend</strong> <br /><br /></p> <p></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: left; '><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: left; '><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020 <br /></b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Production of chemicals, by hazard class</p> </td> <td> <p align='center'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /><br /></p> <p align='center'></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Risks for the environment and health associated with the use of hazardous substances, including chemicals in products, are assessed and minimised  7th EAP</p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/da466c84-2e67-4e97-83a1-3a87190ae755.jpeg' alt='Stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow circle: it is uncertain whether or not the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>While the production of chemicals that are hazardous to health has declined over the years, it is not possible to equate this to a reduction in the risks to environment and health and the outlook towards 2020 is therefore unclear</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes a number of chemical-related goals, one of which is that health and environmental risks associated with the use of hazardous substances, including chemicals in products, are assessed and minimised by 2020.

This briefing addresses only surface waters. Surface waters are the majority of the volume of EU waters and are important habitats, providing key support to society and the economy throughout Europe, while clean, unpolluted waters are essential for our ecosystems. Surface waters have traditionally been the disposal route for human, agricultural and industrial waste, which has damaged their water quality. They have also been altered (by dams, canalisation etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation, to produce energy and to protect against flooding, all of which can result in damage to their hydromorphology.   Policy targets and progress   The main aim of EU water policy is to ensure that a sufficient quantity of good quality water is available for peoples needs and the environment. The Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) stipulates that EU Member States should aim to achieve good status in all bodies of surface water and groundwater by 2015 unless there are grounds for exemption. The 7th EAP mirrored this objective and called for all European water bodies to reach good status by 2020.   During the last 30 years, significant progress has been made in reducing the pollution in numerous European water bodies, in particular thanks to improved wastewater treatment. Water quality in Europe has therefore improved significantly in recent decades, and the effects of pollutants have decreased (EEA 2015a, 2015b). Pollution from agriculture (in particular nitrogen losses from agricultural land) and urban and industrial wastewater nevertheless remain significant. For decades, sometimes centuries, humans have altered European surface waters (straightening and canalisation, disconnection of flood plains, land reclamation, dams, weirs, bank reinforcements, etc.) to facilitate agriculture and urbanisation, produce energy and protect against flooding. These activities have resulted in damage to the morphology and hydrology of the water bodies, i.e. to their hydromorphology.   Based on the first river basin management plans reported in 2008, more than half of the surface water bodies in Europe are in less than good ecological status or potential, and will need mitigation and/or restoration measures to meet the Water Framework Directive  objective (Figure1).  Rivers and transitional waters are on average in a worse condition than lakes and coastal waters. Concerns about the ecological status of surface water bodies are most pronounced for central and north-western Europe, in areas with intensive agricultural practices and high population densities. The status of coastal and transitional waters in the Black Sea and greater North Sea regions is also of concern.      Figure 1.  Ecological status or potential of classified rivers, lakes, coastal and transitional waters, EU          In 2009, 43% of surface water bodies were in good or high ecological status and, in 2015, 53% of water bodies were expected to reach good ecological status. This is far from meeting the objective of good ecological status and only constitutes a modest improvement in ecological status. Given this modest improvement and despite ongoing efforts, it is unlikely that the objective of achieving good status of waters will be met.    Country level information    As Figure2 illustrates, there are differences betweenriver basin districts with regard to the percentage of their water bodies that have good ecological status. Surface water bodies in north-western Europe have the lowest status and/or greatest potential for improvement. In Belgium (Flanders), northern Germany and the Netherlands, more than 90% of surface waters are reported to be in less than good(i.e. moderate, poor or bad) ecologicalstatus or potential.Other problem areas are in the Czech Republic, southern England, northern France, southern Germany, Hungary and Poland, as well as several individual river basin districts in other EU Member States, where 7090% of freshwater bodies (lakes and rivers) are reported to be in less than good status or potential. The status of coastal and transitional waters, in the Black Sea and greater North Sea regions is also of great concern.   Figure 2.  Percentage of classified surface water bodies in different river basin districtsholding less than good ecological status or potential, for rivers and lakes (top panel) and for coastal and transitional waters (bottom panel)            Note: Switzerland data sets on river and lake water quality reported in the framework of EEA priority data flows are not compatible with the EU Water Framework Directive assessments and are not included above.  Source:  WISE WFD Database .            Outlook beyond 2020   Further efforts will be required beyond 2020 to achieve a good status for all surface waters. To achieve good status, Member States will have to address the pressures affecting water bodies. Pollution will be one pressure (e.g. run-off from agriculture, wastewater from households and industry); morphological changes, overabstraction and hydrological changes affecting water flow would also play a role. Full implementation of the Water Framework Directive throughout all sectors will be needed to reduce these pressures, and in individual river basins it will be necessary to commit users from each sector (e.g. the agriculture sector) to focusing on delivering healthy water bodies with good status.    About the indicator    Achieving good status involves meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry, morphology and quantity of waters. In general terms, good status means that water shows only a slight change from what would normally be expected under undisturbed conditions (i.e. with a low human impact). This indicator is defined as the number of surface water bodies reaching at least good ecological status or good ecological potential. Ecological status and potential is a criterion for the quality of the structure and functioning of surface water ecosystems. More specifically, a surface water body has reached good ecological status when the values of the biological quality elements for the surface water body type show low levels of distortion resulting from human activity, but deviate only slightly from those normally associated with the surface water body type under undisturbed conditions (EU, 2000).   The ecological status is used here as a proxy for the overall status of waters. This is because the ecological status is influenced by water quality (e.g. pollution levels of all types) as well as by the amount of available water. In addition, surface waters constitute the majority of EU waters. Water quantity issues are addressed in the Freshwater use briefing ( AIRS_PO2.4, 2016 ), 1  which covers both surface and groundwaters.   The indicator covers only the current status of surface waters and not past trends. New data will become available in 2017 and the next version of the indicator will include trends.,<table class='plain' style='width: 555px;'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b class='image-inline'>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p><strong>EU indicator past trend</strong> <br /><br /></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p><b><span><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></span></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><strong>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Status in surface waters</p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p style='text-align: center; ' title='Time series not yet available'>NA<sup><a class='external-link' href='#note1' target='_self' title=''>(1)</a></sup></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Achieve good status of transitional and coastal waters and freshwaters  Water Framework Directive<em><span><span><br style='text-align: left; ' /></span></span></em></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p><span>Considering the large proportion of surface waters failing to meet 'good' ecological status, it is unlikely that the objective of achieving good status of waters will be met by 2020</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For the further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>One of the goals of the 7th EAP (EU, 2013) is that the impact of pressures on transitional, coastal and freshwaters (including surface and groundwaters) should be significantly reduced to achieve,maintain or enhance good status, as defined by the Water Framework Directive.

Rather the analysis serves to highlight gaps in the knowledge base for assessing progress towards this objective             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   Pesticide (or plant protection product) use plays an important role in agricultural production, by keeping plants healthy and preventing their destruction by disease and infestation. However, pesticides applied to crops enter soil and surface waters via leaching and run-off and can enter groundwater, negatively affecting non-target species in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This canimpact on habitat function and contribute to biodiversity loss, as well asreducing the quality of ecosystem services, such as insect-mediated pollination, soil formation and composition and the provision of clean drinking water. Pesticide residues in food can also pose a risk for human health, while residues in animal feed pose risks to animal health and can enter the food chain. Particular concerns have been raised regarding the health impacts of human exposure to pesticides with endocrine-disrupting properties (Mnif et al., 2011) and the associated costs to human health (Trasande et al., 2015). In June 2016, the European Commission presented scientific criteria to identify endocrine disruptors in plant protection products and in biocides (EC, 2016), with the aim of protecting human health and the environment. The 7 th  EAP (EU, 2013a) sets the objective that by 2020 the use of plant protection products does not have any harmful effects on human health or unacceptable influence on the environment, and that such products are used sustainably.    Policy targets and progress    Adopted in 2009, the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides (EU, 2009a) aims to reduce impacts on human health and the environment. To this end, Member States established National Action Plans, including quantitative objectives, targets, measures and timetables. These plans should promote low pesticide input pest management and non-chemical methods, including both integrated pest management and organic farming. With the aim of protecting the aquatic environment and drinking water, Member States should adopt measures to minimise off-site pollution from spray drift, drain-flow and run-off. These include establishing buffer zones to separate the usage or storage of pesticides from rivers, lakes and waterways, in particular those used for drinking water abstraction. The first National Action Plans were communicated to the Commission in 2012 and are to be reviewed by the Member States at least every 5 years. Member States are to take all necessary means to achieve the targets set out in the National Action Plans.   Under the Regulation on plant protection products (EU, 2009b), the Commission is required to identify active substances with certain properties as candidates for substitution. Member States will then evaluate whether or not these active substances might be replaced by other pesticides that are less harmful. While this process is currently in the early stages of implementation, over time it should promote the use of less harmful pesticides and provide incentives to industry to develop pesticides with less hazardous properties.   Water quality legislation also generates obligations to control environmental exposure to pesticides. The contamination of surface waters with pesticides is managed under the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000), which requires upstream controls to reduce emissions, discharges and losses of those pesticides that have been identified as priority substances or priority hazardous substances under the Priority Substances Directive (EU, 2013b). The Drinking Water Directive (EU, 1998) stipulates a maximum concentration of 0.1g/l for any single pesticide and its relevant metabolites (to a maximum of 0.5g/l for total pesticides) in potable water. Thresholds are also applied for pesticide residues in food and feed (EU, 2005), and as undesirable substances in animal feed (EU, 2002).   As shown by Figure1, total sales of pesticidesacross the EU as a whole declined from 2011 to 2013,before increasing in 2014 to just under 400 000 tonnes, a level 4% above that seen in2011. This suggests that EU demand for pesticides has remained relatively stable, despite implementation of the National Action Plans under the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.    Figure 1. Total EU pesticides sales         However, this indicator tells us little about the risks associated with pesticide use. It is not possible to directly equate the quantity of pesticides sold with resulting risks to human health and the environment. The risks of pesticide use depend on both the hazard characteristics of the active substances included in the pesticide product and on application methods and use patterns. The climate, landscape, habitat and soil characteristics of the receiving ecosystem, as well as proximity to water bodies, influence how pesticides disperse in the environment. These various aspects strongly influence risk to environment and health, and are not accounted for by measuring the volumes sold on the market.   With the aim of enabling an assessment of EU-level progress in reducing the risks and adverse effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides foresees the establishment of harmonised risk indicators. Development of these indicators is dependent on access to data on pesticide use. The Regulation on pesticide statistics (EU, 2009c) is expected to deliver data in 2016 on the agricultural use of pesticides by crop for 5-year periods, which should facilitate a better understanding of the risks to the environment and human health.   Monitoring data on pesticides in the European environment and in the human population would provide a robust basis for assessing exposure that, in combination with (eco)toxicity data, could enhance our understanding of current risks to human health and the environment. Under theWater Framework Directive, Member States have established a comprehensivenetwork of monitoring stations through which to investigate thepresence of priority substances and priority hazardous substances in surface waters. Several of these substances are pesticides, with monitoring data due to be reported to the EEA in 2016. With regard to human exposure, efforts are ongoing at European level to establish a European Human Biomonitoring Initiative todeliver data on the exposure of the European population to chemicals, including pesticides. Theseactivities should serve to support a more robust assessment of the risks from pesticides to humanhealth and the environment.   The selected indicator does notenable an evaluation of progress towards the 2020 objective. Rather it serves to highlight current gaps in the knowledge base for assessing progress towardsthis objective.   Country level data   In 2014, the countries in which the highest quantities of pesticides were sold were Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, together making up 73 % of the EU-28s pesticide sales. In terms of trends in the sales of pesticides at Member State level, 2011 to 2014 saw reductions in the volumes sold in 13 Member States, with significant reductions in Denmark (63% reduction), Ireland (26% reduction), Malta (16% reduction), Greece (15% reduction) and Romania (12% reduction). Meanwhile, pesticide sales increased in 11 countries, with significant increases in Estonia (30% increase), Latvia (32% increase) and France (23% increase). Data was not available to assess trends in four Member States. In Norway, pesticide sales increased by 4 % from 2011 to 2014, while in Switzerland sales remained stable (Eurostat, 2016a).   Figure2 shows the quantities of pesticides sold on the market against the land area that was utilised for agricultural production in 2013 by each Member State. In 2013, Bulgaria had the smallest proportion of pesticide sales per hectare of utilised agricultural area, with 0.22kg/ha. Ireland, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Latvia, Romania, Greece, Sweden and Lithuania all had quantities of sold pesticides under 1kilogram per ha of utilised agricultural area. Slovenia, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Malta all had quantities of pesticides sold per hectare above 2kg/ha. Malta recorded the highest quantity of pesticides sold per hectare, with a value of 9.97kg/ha (Eurostat, 2016b).    Figure 2. Pesticide sales per utilised agricultural area, by country for 2013         Outlook beyond 2020   There are a number of conflicting trends expected to influence future demand for pesticides. The implementation of National Action Plans by Member States should foster the sustainable use of pesticides in the long term,as well aspromoting integrated pest management and organic farming. The EU has seen an upward trend in organic farming, with the total organic area in the EU ( i.e. the area fully converted to organic production and the area under conversion)    having increased by 21 % from 2010 to 2015 to cover 11.1 million hectares (Eurostat, 2016d). While a continuation of this trend in future years may serve to reduce overall EU demand for pesticides, there is a significant variation in the proportion of organic farming in agricultural production among different EU Member States. On the other hand, global food production will need to increase in order to feed a population estimated to rise above 9.6 billion by 2050 (EEA, 2015). The associated increase in demandmay drive furtherintensification of agricultural production and lead to an increased demand for agrochemicals.   In terms of technological developments, precision agriculture offers the potential to optimise the relationship between productivity and inputs, thereby increasing the sustainability of agricultural production. The approach employs sensors and global navigation satellite systems to manage spatial and temporal variability in the demand for agricultural inputs. In the case of pesticides, this involves ensuring that application rates are precisely tailored to needs, for example by responding to variability in the scale and density of crops or the presence of natural enemies of insect pests. Further research is required to fully understand the environmental benefits of precision agriculture and to promote its uptake, where relevant (JRC, 2015).   About the indicator   The indicator provides data on the volumes of sales of the active substances contained in pesticides. Sales data for active substances are reported by the Member States to Eurostat under the Regulation on pesticide statistics (EU, 2009c). This Regulation covers pesticides, or plant protection products, defined as products consisting of or containing active substances, safeners or synergists, and intended for one of the following uses:     protecting plants or plant products against all harmful organisms or preventing the action of such organisms, unless the main purpose of these products is considered to be for reasons of hygiene rather than for the protection of plants or plant products;   influencing the life processes of plants, such as substances influencing their growth, other than as a nutrient; preserving plant products, in so far as such substances or products are not subject to special European Community provisions on preservatives;   destroying undesired plants or parts of plants, except algae, unless the products are applied on soil or water to protect plants; or   checking or preventing undesired growth of plants, except algae.     An active substance is a substance or micro-organism, including viruses, that has general or specific action against harmful organisms or on plants, parts of plants or plant products.

However, pesticides applied to crops enter soil and surface waters via leaching and run-off and can enter groundwater, negatively affecting non-target species in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This canimpact on habitat function and contribute to biodiversity loss, as well asreducing the quality of ecosystem services, such as insect-mediated pollination, soil formation and composition and the provision of clean drinking water. Pesticide residues in food can also pose a risk for human health, while residues in animal feed pose risks to animal health and can enter the food chain. Particular concerns have been raised regarding the health impacts of human exposure to pesticides with endocrine-disrupting properties (Mnif et al., 2011) and the associated costs to human health (Trasande et al., 2015). In June 2016, the European Commission presented scientific criteria to identify endocrine disruptors in plant protection products and in biocides (EC, 2016), with the aim of protecting human health and the environment. The 7<sup>th</sup> EAP (EU, 2013a) sets the objective that by 2020 the use of plant protection products does not have any harmful effects on human health or unacceptable influence on the environment, and that such products are used sustainably.</p> <h2><span>Policy targets and progress</span></h2> <p>Adopted in 2009, the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides (EU, 2009a) aims to reduce impacts on human health and the environment. To this end, Member States established National Action Plans, including quantitative objectives, targets, measures and timetables. These plans should promote low pesticide input pest management and non-chemical methods, including both integrated pest management and organic farming. With the aim of protecting the aquatic environment and drinking water, Member States should adopt measures to minimise off-site pollution from spray drift, drain-flow and run-off. These include establishing buffer zones to separate the usage or storage of pesticides from rivers, lakes and waterways, in particular those used for drinking water abstraction. The first National Action Plans were communicated to the Commission in 2012 and are to be reviewed by the Member States at least every 5 years. Member States are to take all necessary means to achieve the targets set out in the National Action Plans.</p> <p>Under the Regulation on plant protection products (EU, 2009b), the Commission is required to identify active substances with certain properties as candidates for substitution. Member States will then evaluate whether or not these active substances might be replaced by other pesticides that are less harmful. While this process is currently in the early stages of implementation, over time it should promote the use of less harmful pesticides and provide incentives to industry to develop pesticides with less hazardous properties.</p> <p>Water quality legislation also generates obligations to control environmental exposure to pesticides. The contamination of surface waters with pesticides is managed under the Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000), which requires upstream controls to reduce emissions, discharges and losses of those pesticides that have been identified as priority substances or priority hazardous substances under the Priority Substances Directive (EU, 2013b). The Drinking Water Directive (EU, 1998) stipulates a maximum concentration of 0.1g/l for any single pesticide and its relevant metabolites (to a maximum of 0.5g/l for total pesticides) in potable water. Thresholds are also applied for pesticide residues in food and feed (EU, 2005), and as undesirable substances in animal feed (EU, 2002).</p> <p>As shown by Figure1, total sales of pesticidesacross the EU as a whole declined from 2011 to 2013,before increasing in 2014 to just under 400 000 tonnes, a level 4% above that seen in2011. This suggests that EU demand for pesticides has remained relatively stable, despite implementation of the National Action Plans under the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Figure 1.

It is not possible to directly equate the quantity of pesticides sold with resulting risks to human health and the environment. The risks of pesticide use depend on both the hazard characteristics of the active substances included in the pesticide product and on application methods and use patterns. The climate, landscape, habitat and soil characteristics of the receiving ecosystem, as well as proximity to water bodies, influence how pesticides disperse in the environment. These various aspects strongly influence risk to environment and health, and are not accounted for by measuring the volumes sold on the market.</p> <p>With the aim of enabling an assessment of EU-level progress in reducing the risks and adverse effects of pesticides on human health and the environment, the Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides foresees the establishment of harmonised risk indicators. Development of these indicators is dependent on access to data on pesticide use. The Regulation on pesticide statistics (EU, 2009c) is expected to deliver data in 2016 on the agricultural use of pesticides by crop for 5-year periods, which should facilitate a better understanding of the risks to the environment and human health.</p> <p>Monitoring data on pesticides in the European environment and in the human population would provide a robust basis for assessing exposure that, in combination with (eco)toxicity data, could enhance our understanding of current risks to human health and the environment. Under theWater Framework Directive, Member States have established a comprehensivenetwork of monitoring stations through which to investigate thepresence of priority substances and priority hazardous substances in surface waters. Several of these substances are pesticides, with monitoring data due to be reported to the EEA in 2016. With regard to human exposure, efforts are ongoing at European level to establish a European Human Biomonitoring Initiative todeliver data on the exposure of the European population to chemicals, including pesticides. Theseactivities should serve to support a more robust assessment of the risks from pesticides to humanhealth and the environment.</p> <p>The selected indicator does notenable an evaluation of progress towards the 2020 objective. Rather it serves to highlight current gaps in the knowledge base for assessing progress towardsthis objective.</p> <h2 class='figureHeading'>Country level data</h2> <p>In 2014, the countries in which the highest quantities of pesticides were sold were Spain, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, together making up 73 % of the EU-28s pesticide sales. In terms of trends in the sales of pesticides at Member State level, 2011 to 2014 saw reductions in the volumes sold in 13 Member States, with significant reductions in Denmark (63% reduction), Ireland (26% reduction), Malta (16% reduction), Greece (15% reduction) and Romania (12% reduction). Meanwhile, pesticide sales increased in 11 countries, with significant increases in Estonia (30% increase), Latvia (32% increase) and France (23% increase). Data was not available to assess trends in four Member States. In Norway, pesticide sales increased by 4 % from 2011 to 2014, while in Switzerland sales remained stable (Eurostat, 2016a).</p> <p>Figure2 shows the quantities of pesticides sold on the market against the land area that was utilised for agricultural production in 2013 by each Member State. In 2013, Bulgaria had the smallest proportion of pesticide sales per hectare of utilised agricultural area, with 0.22kg/ha. Ireland, Estonia, Finland, Denmark, Latvia, Romania, Greece, Sweden and Lithuania all had quantities of sold pesticides under 1kilogram per ha of utilised agricultural area. Slovenia, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Malta all had quantities of pesticides sold per hectare above 2kg/ha. Malta recorded the highest quantity of pesticides sold per hectare, with a value of 9.97kg/ha (Eurostat, 2016b).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><b><span>Figure 2.

The implementation of National Action Plans by Member States should foster the sustainable use of pesticides in the long term,as well aspromoting integrated pest management and organic farming. The EU has seen an upward trend in organic farming, with the total organic area in the EU (<span>i.e. the area fully converted to organic production and the area under conversion)</span><span> </span>having increased by 21 % from 2010 to 2015 to cover 11.1 million hectares (Eurostat, 2016d). While a continuation of this trend in future years may serve to reduce overall EU demand for pesticides, there is a significant variation in the proportion of organic farming in agricultural production among different EU Member States. On the other hand, global food production will need to increase in order to feed a population estimated to rise above 9.6 billion by 2050 (EEA, 2015). The associated increase in demandmay drive furtherintensification of agricultural production and lead to an increased demand for agrochemicals.</p> <p>In terms of technological developments, precision agriculture offers the potential to optimise the relationship between productivity and inputs, thereby increasing the sustainability of agricultural production. The approach employs sensors and global navigation satellite systems to manage spatial and temporal variability in the demand for agricultural inputs. In the case of pesticides, this involves ensuring that application rates are precisely tailored to needs, for example by responding to variability in the scale and density of crops or the presence of natural enemies of insect pests. Further research is required to fully understand the environmental benefits of precision agriculture and to promote its uptake, where relevant (JRC, 2015).</p> <h2>About the indicator</h2> <p>The indicator provides data on the volumes of sales of the active substances contained in pesticides. Sales data for active substances are reported by the Member States to Eurostat under the Regulation on pesticide statistics (EU, 2009c).

It is therefore unlikely that the 2020 target will be met             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes the objective of halting loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services by 2020. Preserving and restoring the EUs protected habitats is a key element in achieving this. An EU-wide network of protected habitats in good conservation status is crucial, not only for the intrinsic value of these habitats and the species that depend on them, but also because protecting them is important to ensure provision of a wide range of ecosystem servicesnatural flood protection, air and water quality regulation, pollination, recreation, etc.for the benefit of EU citizens.    Policy targets and progress    In line with the 7th EAP objective, the overall aim of the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 (EC, 2011) is to halt loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020. The Habitats Directive (EU, 1992) aims to ensure that the habitats of European interest are in a good status. Target 1 of the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets out the specific goal that, by 2020, 100% more habitatassessments under the Habitats Directive show a favourable or improved conservation status.In practice this means that, by 2020, 34% of habitats assessments should have either reached a favourable conservation status or shown a significant improvement in their status.   Overall results for conservation status and trends reported under the Habitats Directive for the 20072012period show that only 16.4% of habitat assessmentshave a favourable conservation status, while 77% are unfavourable. Of the unfavourable assessments, only 4.4% have improving trends, 33% are stable and 30% show ongoing deterioration. Consequently, only around 21% of habitat assessments have reached the target condition, which is still some way short of the 2020 targetof 34% (EC, 2015; EEA, 2015a). For habitats associated with agricultural ecosystems (grassland and cropland), 39% of assessments showed deterioration compared with the previous reporting period (EC, 2015).   Looking at conservation status by main habitat group (see Figure1), favourable conservation status is lowest for dune habitats and highest for rocky habitats (mostly in high mountain areas and away from human activities). For conservation status trends, unfavourable and deteriorating is particularly high for bogs, mires and fens, but also for grasslands. Marine habitats assessments also give rise for concern: only 9% were in a favourable conservation status, 66% were considered to be in unfavourable status and 25% were categorised as having unknown status. However, it should be noted that the number of marine habitats covered under this Directive is very low.   Figure 1. Conservation status and trends of habitats assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), EU        Overall, the conservation status of EU protected habitats has not improved, and habitats of European interestshow a worse conservation status and trend than species of European interest.   Several factors contribute to this. Firstly, habitat restoration can often take a long time to get from the initial implementation of measures to the achievement of tangible improvement in conservation status. A key component in the implementation of the Habitats and Birds Directives is the Natura 2000 network, an EU-wide network of nature conservation areas. The terrestrial Natura 2000 network designation is now considered largely complete (18% of EU land). The coverage of protected marine areas has increased to 6% but still requires substantial additional effort. The effective management and restoration of Natura 2000 sites is central to improving the conservation status of habitats. In 2012, however, only 58% of Natura 2000 sites had management plans, or had such plans in development (EEA, 2015a). Similarly, other measures that can benefit conservation status are still being implemented across the EU, e.g. policy measures anticipated under the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Common Agricultural Policy reform and the increased integration of biodiversity objectives in the EUs financial instruments.   Finally, EU terrestrial habitats continue to be subject to many pressures, including agricultural practices such as modification of cultivation techniques, overgrazing, abandonment of pastoral systems, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides, as well as human-induced modifications of natural conditions (mostly related to hydrological changes). For marine habitats, the main reported pressure and threat is pollution. Many of these threats and pressures arise from a wide range of sectors and policies (including agriculture, fisheries, forestry and transport) and are expected to be ongoing. Consequently, the fate of European biodiversity is closely intertwined with developments in these areas. The adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors and regional policies remains critical, therefore, in attempting to reduce the pressures on biodiversity (EEA, 2015b).   Given the limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and the ongoing cumulative pressures on these habitats, it is very unlikely that the 2020 target for conservation status of habitats will be met.   Country level information   At the level of EU Member States, the majority of assessments indicate a low proportion of habitats in a favourable condition, with notable exceptionsCyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Sloveniareporting more than 40% of habitat assessments as favourable. The countries reporting the most habitat assessments with unfavourable status are all in northern EuropeBelgium, Denmark, the Netherlands andthe United Kingdom (see Figure2). This pattern can probably be attributed mainly to the relatively intensive agriculture practised in these Member States. As for the conservation status trends within the reporting period (20072012), there are overall more declining than improving habitat assessments.   Figure 2. Conservation status and trends of habitats assessed under the Habitats Directive (2007-2012), by country        Outlook beyond 2020   Achieving favourable conservation status for EU protected habitats in the longer term is challenging. This is due to the expected continuation of many environmental pressures, with some pressures such as climate change set to increase, and to the time lag between the implementation of restoration measures and the desired outcomes in terms of habitat conservation status. Marine habitats are especially challenging because of their currently poor status, and a substantial increase in the network of protected marine areas still needs to be implemented.    About the indicator    The indicator covers habitats that are considered to be of European interest (listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive). The Habitats Directive protects 233 rare and characteristic natural and semi-natural habitat types (e.g. types of grasslands, wetlands, dunes) within the territory of the EU. Their conservation status is assessed by all EU Member States every 6 years, and these assessments and other data from the Member States are subsequently used to make EU-level assessments. There have been two reporting rounds so far (20002006 and 20072012).   The indicator measures conservation status for habitat types in terms offavourable, unfavourableinadequate, unfavourablebad and unknown. Furthermore, the indicator measures trends for assessments with unfavourable conservation status: unfavourable improving, unfavourablestable, unfavourabledeteriorating, unfavourableunknown. The assessments are based on four parameters: (1) trends and status of range; (2) trends and status of the area; (3)structure and function including typical species; and(4)future prospects.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b class='image-inline'>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span><strong>EU indicator past trend <br /></strong></span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Habitats of European interest</p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: center; '><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-triangle-deteriorating-trend/@@images/7f0c4bbe-354c-4a58-942a-26561fbaebd4.jpeg' alt='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' class='image-inline' title='Red triangle: deteriorating trend' /></em></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '><span>Ensure that 34 % of habitat assessments under the Habitats Directive are in a favourable or improved conservation status  EU Biodiversity Strategy </span></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4'> <p>The EU has shown limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and the pressures on these habitats remain.

The adequate integration of biodiversity considerations into certain economic sectors and regional policies remains critical, therefore, in attempting to reduce the pressures on biodiversity (EEA, 2015b).</p> <p>Given the limited progress in improving the conservation status of EU protected habitats and the ongoing cumulative pressures on these habitats, it is very unlikely that the 2020 target for conservation status of habitats will be met.</p> <h2>Country level information</h2> <p>At the level of EU Member States, the majority of assessments indicate a low proportion of habitats in a favourable condition, with notable exceptionsCyprus, Estonia, Malta, Romania and Sloveniareporting more than 40% of habitat assessments as favourable. The countries reporting the most habitat assessments with unfavourable status are all in northern EuropeBelgium, Denmark, the Netherlands andthe United Kingdom (see Figure2). This pattern can probably be attributed mainly to the relatively intensive agriculture practised in these Member States. As for the conservation status trends within the reporting period (20072012), there are overall more declining than improving habitat assessments.</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 2.

This is due to the expected continuation of many environmental pressures, with some pressures such as climate change set to increase, and to the time lag between the implementation of restoration measures and the desired outcomes in terms of habitat conservation status. Marine habitats are especially challenging because of their currently poor status, and a substantial increase in the network of protected marine areas still needs to be implemented.</p> <h2><span>About the indicator</span></h2> <p>The indicator covers habitats that are considered to be of European interest (listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive). The Habitats Directive protects 233 rare and characteristic natural and semi-natural habitat types (e.g. types of grasslands, wetlands, dunes) within the territory of the EU. Their conservation status is assessed by all EU Member States every 6 years, and these assessments and other data from the Member States are subsequently used to make EU-level assessments. There have been two reporting rounds so far (20002006 and 20072012).</p> <p>The indicator measures conservation status for habitat types in terms offavourable, unfavourableinadequate, unfavourablebad and unknown. Furthermore, the indicator measures trends for assessments with unfavourable conservation status: unfavourable improving, unfavourablestable, unfavourabledeteriorating, unfavourableunknown. The assessments are based on four parameters: (1) trends and status of range; (2) trends and status of the area; (3)structure and function including typical species; and(4)future prospects.</p> <p><span></span></p>","EU protected habitats",,"<p>The SeventhEnvironment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes the objective of halting loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystem services by 2020. The Habitats Directive is one of the cornerstones in EU biodiversity legislation and aims to preserve and restore EU protected habitats. According to the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, 34% of habitat assessments should be in a favourable or improved conservation status by 2020. The latest assessment from 20072012 shows that only 16% of the assessments of habitats have a favourable conservation status and only 4% of assessments have shown an improvement compared with 20012006. Habitats continue to face pressures from, for example, land use change and pollution. In addition, habitat status often takes a long time to improve when conservation and other measures are first implemented. It is therefore unlikely that the 2020 target will be met.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-27T16:04:27Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Austria,Czech Republic,Cyprus,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Netherlands,Greece,Germany,Lithuania,Belgium,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Biodiversity and ecosystems","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/natural-capital/eu-protected-habitats","Briefing (all)","2014,2003,2015,2004,2016,2005,2006,2017,2018,2007,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2012,2001,2013,2002","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

This briefing addresses the issue of energy efficiency, with greenhouse gas emissions ( AIRS_PO2.5, 2015 ) 1  and renewables ( AIRS_PO2.6 ) 2  being considered in two other related briefings. Meeting the energy efficiency target requires a reduction in energy consumption. This should lead to a reduction in environmental pressures associated with the production and consumption of energy. It will also contribute to a reduction in dependence on energy imports and support the achievement of renewable energy and greenhouse gas targets.        Policy targets and progress       The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) (EU, 2012) has a target of increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020 compared with a business-as-usual scenario (EC, 2011). The EED translates this into two separate 2020 reduction targets for the EUs primary and final energy consumption: a primary energy consumption of 1483Mtoe, representing a 13.4%reduction compared with 2005 levels, and a final energyconsumption of 1086Mtoe, representing an 8.8% reduction compared with 2005 levels.        In 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was 11.8% lower than in 2005 (see Figure 1). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, the EUs primary energy consumption increased slightly in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014), while still remaining below the indicative linear trajectory (EEA, 2016a).           Figure 1.  Primary and finalenergy consumption in the EU andtargets for 2020 and 2030             In 2014, the EU has reduced its final energy consumption by 10.9% compared with 2005, which was already below the target level set for 2020. The energy demand in 2014 was exceptionally low because of favourable climatic conditions in 2014 (warm winter), which limited the demand for energy for heating in the EU Member States.    Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 decreased by 12%, particularly as a result of the reduction in final energy consumption observed during that period. The other factors contributing to this decrease included improved efficiency in the conversion of primary sources(e.g. coal and gas) into final energy and changes in the fuel mix to produce electricity and heat (higher penetration of renewable energy).   In the same period, final energy consumption in the EU-28 decreased by 10.9% in all sectors, with the industry and household sectors registering the largest decrease of 16.5% and 14.8%, respectively, followed by transport (4.5%) and services (1.7%). This development was influenced by energy efficiency policies, structural changes in industry, the economic downturn and the warmer winter.   Apart from the EED, other policies and measures adopted at EU level are expected to contribute towards the 20% reduction target. These include:     The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EU, 2010a),   Product regulations laying down minimum energy performance standards and requirements for energy labelling (the Eco-design Directive (EU, 2009) and the Labelling Directive (EU, 2010b),   CO 2  performance standards for cars and vans,   Increased financing through EU structural and investment funds, Horizon 2020 and dedicated facilities, such as European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) and the European Energy Efficiency Fund,   The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the Effort Sharing Decision for non-ETS sectors.          Almost half of the effort to reach the 2020 target at EU level should come from measures implemented  under Article 7   (1)   of the EED. The use of exemptions by Member States to reduce this target, as well as the inclusion of measures that are not eligible, might limit the contribution of the commitments made under this requirement to fulfil national energy efficiency targets (Ricardo-AEA et al., 2015).     Country level information   Figure 2. Primary Energy consumption in 2005 and 2015 and estimated national target for 2020         In 2014, 25 Member States reduced or limited their increase in primary energy consumption below the linear trajectories drawn between 2005 levels and the 2020 targets. Three Member States (Estonia, Malta and Sweden) had not achieved sufficient savings in primary energy consumption. According to preliminary data, the situation improved in 2015 for Estonia and Sweden, for which primary energy consumption levels fell below their respective linear trajectories. In contrast, in Bulgaria, France and Germany, primary energy consumption in 2015 was above their respective trajectories (EEA, 2016b).    Outlook beyond 2020   Continued improvements in energy efficiency will be needed well beyond 2020 if the 7th EAPs 2050 vision of Europe, in which low-carbon growth has long been decoupled from resource use, is to be achieved. In October 2014, the European Council endorsed an indicative energy efficiency target of a reduction of at least 27% by 2030, in comparison with the ECs 2007 energy baseline scenario (EC, 2014). This target should be reviewed by 2020, having in mind a 30% target.   About the indicator   Improving energy efficiency means using less energy for the same output or producing more with the same energy input. The 2020 target for energy efficiency has been interpreted to mean reductions in primary and final energy consumption. The indicator tracks levels of primary and final energy consumption in million tonnes of oil equivalents. Primary energy in this context covers the consumption of the energy sector itself, losses during the transformation (for example, from oil or gas into electricity) and distribution of energy, and final consumption by end users. It excludes energy carriers used for non-energy purposes (such as petroleum used for producing plastics). Final energy consumption is the total energy consumed by end users, such as households, industry, services, agriculture and fisheries. It is the energy that reaches the final consumers door and excludes the energy used by the energy sector itself and in deliveries to the transformation sector.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Progress on energy efficiency in Europe</p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; '> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></span></p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: left; '>Improve energy efficiency by 20 % (compared with a business-as-usual scenario)  Energy Efficiency Directive</p> </td> <td> <p><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' alt='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' class='image-inline' title='Green circle: it is expected that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='147'> <p>The EU as a whole is currently on track to meet its energy efficiency target.

Environmental noise causes at least 10000 cases of premature death in Europe each year, with almost 20 million adults suffering annoyance and a further 8 million suffering sleep disturbance (EEA, 2014). The WHO (2011) identified noise as the second most significant environmental cause of ill health, the first being air pollution ( AIRS_PO3.1, 2016 ). 1  The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes an objective to significantly decrease noise pollution by 2020, moving closer to WHO recommended levels.   Policy targets and progress   The Environmental Noise Directive (END) is the main EU instrument through which land-based noise emissions are monitored and actions developed. It defines environmental noise as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, rail traffic, air traffic, and from sites of industrial activity (EU, 2002). It places an obligation on EU Member States to assess noise levels by producing strategic noise maps for all major roads, railways, airports and urban areas. Based on these noise-mapping results, Member States must prepare action plans containing measures that address noise issues and their effects for those areas where the specific END indicators (55dB averaged across the day, evening and night periods (L den ) and 50dB averaged across the night period (L night )) have been surpassed. The Directive neither sets limit values for noise exposure, nor prescribes measures for inclusion in the action plans. Finally, Member States are required to select and preserve areas of good acoustic environmental quality, referred to as quiet areas, in order to protect the European soundscape.   High noise levels are defined in the 7th EAP as noise levels for L den  above 55dB and for L night  above 50dB. During the night, high noise levels can cause sleep disturbance, such as body movements and wakening, starting at L night  levels below 40dB, and with effects on the cardiovascular system that become apparent above 55dB. All these impacts can contribute to premature mortality (WHO, 2009).   The WHO established a night-time noise guideline for L night  of 40dB for outside noise with the aim of protecting the public, including vulnerable groups such as children, the chronically ill and the elderly. An outside noise L night  value of 55dB was recommended as an interim target for countries where the night-time noise guideline cannot be achieved in the short term and where policymakers adopt a stepwise approach. The WHO night-time noise guideline is stricter than the L night  threshold of 50dB set under the END, providing a higher level of protection for human health. However, assessments cannot be made by comparing noise levels in Europe with WHO recommended levels, as Member States are not obliged to report this information.   Figure 1 provides an overview of the number of people exposed to levels of environmental noise in Europe that are above the noise indicators set by the END within and outside urban areas. The major source of noise pollution (measured in terms of number of affected people), both inside and outside urban areas, is road traffic. Noise from trains and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of overall population exposure to noise, but it remains the major source of localised noise pollution (EEA, 2015).   More specifically, it is estimated that more than 125 million people in the EU are exposed to L den  levels from road traffic noise that are above 55dB.   Night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans exposed to harmful L night  levels above 50dB. In addition, many people are also exposed to rail, aircraft and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities. While aircraft noise does not affect a wide geographical area, the effects extend beyond health impacts on nearby populations to direct effects on the ability of younger generations to concentrate in schools that are affected by aircraft flight paths.    Figure 1. Estimated number of people exposed in the EU to noise above Lden 55 dB, 2012             Note: 1.'Urban areas are the urban agglomerations defined as such in the Environmental Noise Directive, that is the part of the territory, delimited by the Member State, having a population in excess of 100 000 persons and a population density such that the Member State considers it to be an urbanised area.   2. The numbers of people exposed can only be summed for the same source inside and outside urban areas and not across sources, since the latter could lead to double counting. 3. 55 dB Lden is the EU threshold for excess exposure defined in the Environmental Noise Directive and indicating an average level during the day, evening and night; dB=decibel.         Examples of measures to reduce noise exposure currently being undertaken at the national level include installing road and rail noise barriers and optimising aircraft movements around airports. However, it is widely acknowledged that the most effective actions to reduce exposure tend to be those that reduce noise at source, for example reducing the number of vehicles on the road, introducing quieter tyres for road vehicles or laying quieter road surfaces.   A major problem for the effectiveness of such measures is that, given the different factors that determine traffic noise, a single measure alone is often not sufficient to significantly reduce exposure.   Efforts to reduce the noise from individual sources tend to be offset by the higher numbers of people being exposed to high noise levels, due to increasing road and aviation traffic and increasing numbers of city inhabitants. Recent trends show a rise in car travel across the EU, with 77% of passenger-kilometres using car transport in 2013 compared with 65% in 2000 (EEA, 2015). The construction of new roads can also expose new areas and populations to road traffic noise.   In terms of the availability of data to assess recent trends in noise exposure, data were reported to the EEA in 2007 and in 2012 under two rounds of noise mapping assessments. There are, however, comparability issues between the two reporting rounds, because of a lack of common assessment methods and incomplete reporting of exposure assessments, with as little as 44 70 % of the expected amount of data, depending on source, being delivered in the second reporting round. However, the analysis of a sub-set of the reported data that were comparable revealed that exposure to noise has remained broadly constant between 2007 and 2012.   Finally, it is unlikely that noise pollution will decrease significantly by 2020, given that transport demand is expected to increase (EC, 2016), air traffic noise has been predicted to increase (EASA et al, 2016) and the  number of city inhabitants is also set to increase (Eurostat, 2016).    Country level information     Road traffic is the most widespread noise source in Europe and the source that causes the largest number of people to be exposed above the Environmental Noise Directive action levels for L den  and L night . This is true at the European scale, at country scale and both inside and outside urban areas. Nevertheless, a wide variation can be identified between countries in the number of people exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. This is significantly influenced by factors such as the number of urban areas per country and the total number of inhabitants per urban area. The correlation between the total number of inhabitants in an urban area and the number of people exposed to road traffic noise is very strong.   Austria, Estonia, Ireland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Switzerland reported that more than 50% of inhabitants in urban areas (an urban agglomeration with more than 100000 inhabitants) were exposed to road noise L den  levels above 55dB, while Belgium, Bulgaria and Luxembourg reported figures of more than 75% for the equivalent exposure (Figure 2). At the other end of the scale, the number of inhabitants exposed to road noise L den  levels above 55dB in Germany, Iceland and Malta remained below 25%. As mentioned above, however, country-specific data are not immediately comparable.   Figure 2. Percentage of population exposed to road noise within urban areas above Lden 55 dB, by country, 2012       Note:   55 dB Lden is the EU threshold for excess exposure defined in the Environmental Noise Directive and indicating an average level during the day, evening and night; dB=decibel.    Outlook beyond 2020     Regarding the long-term outlook for the European soundscape, there are a number of challenges to reducing the exposure of the EU population to noise pollution. Economic growth and expanding transport networks can lead to increased transport levels that could, in turn, increase noise pollution. At the same time, trends towards increasing urbanisation (Eurostat, 2016) could lead to higher numbers of people being exposed. Transport demand, including for passenger cars is expected to increase by 2050 (EC, 2016 and EEA, 2015), with noise from road traffic representing the dominant source of environmental noise and noise from air traffic set to increase (EASA et al, 2016). On the other hand, intelligent transport systems could reduce noise levels from vehicles, in particular road vehicles. While the use of electric cars currently contributes to lower noise levels at low speeds in urban areas, the new EU regulation on the sound levels of motor vehicles (EU, 2014) will require the installation of artificial sound generators in all electric and hybrid vehicles by 2021 to improve safety for pedestrians. Whether or not exposure to noise increases or decreases beyond 2020 depends on the relative rates of these conflicting developments.   About the indicator     The Environmental Noise Directive (END) requires two main indicators to be applied in the assessment and management of environmental noise. The first indicator (L den ) is the noise level for the day, evening and night periods and is designed to measure annoyance. The END defines an L den  threshold of 55dB. The second indicator (L night ) is the noise level for night-time periods and is designed to assess sleep disturbance. The END defines an L night  threshold of 50dB. These indicators were calculated following the provisions of the END (EU, 2002). Member States must report the numbers of people who are exposed to noise levels above both thresholds for each noise source (e.g. roads, railways, airports, industry). The EEA uses these data to create an indicator for environmental noise in Europe. A complete assessment of exposure to environmental noise and a prognosis regarding the future outlook are hindered by the fact that exposure estimates reported by countries are not complete, with as little as 44 70 % of the expected amount of data, depending on source, being delivered in the second reporting round (EEA, 2014). The gaps in the reported data have been filled with expert estimates from the EEA. The lack of comparable and common assessment methods often causes significant inconsistencies between exposure estimates from different countries, within a single country and across the two main reporting rounds (2007 and 2012).,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>EU indicator pasttrend</b></p> <p></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Exposure to environmental noise</p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: center; '><img alt='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/yellow-triangle-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/34c5620c-2c83-4ecd-bbb1-6a50195c1e86.jpeg' title='Yellow triangle: stable or unclear trend' /></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Significantly decrease noise pollution  7th EAP</p> </td> <td> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='825'> <p>Efforts to reduce environmental noise tend to be offset by an increase in the number of people being exposed to high noise levels, in particular due to increasing road and aviation traffic and an increase in the number of city inhabitants</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2>Setting the Scene</h2> <p>Noise exposure from transport sources and industry can lead to annoyance, stress reactions, sleep disturbance, and increases in the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Environmental noise causes at least 10000 cases of premature death in Europe each year, with almost 20 million adults suffering annoyance and a further 8 million suffering sleep disturbance (EEA, 2014). The WHO (2011) identified noise as the second most significant environmental cause of ill health, the first being air pollution (<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/environment-and-health/outdoor-air-quality-urban-areas' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO3.1, 2016</a>).<sup>1</sup> The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) includes an objective to significantly decrease noise pollution by 2020, moving closer to WHO recommended levels.</p> <h2>Policy targets and progress</h2> <p>The Environmental Noise Directive (END) is the main EU instrument through which land-based noise emissions are monitored and actions developed. It defines environmental noise as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, rail traffic, air traffic, and from sites of industrial activity (EU, 2002). It places an obligation on EU Member States to assess noise levels by producing strategic noise maps for all major roads, railways, airports and urban areas. Based on these noise-mapping results, Member States must prepare action plans containing measures that address noise issues and their effects for those areas where the specific END indicators (55dB averaged across the day, evening and night periods (L<sub>den</sub>) and 50dB averaged across the night period (L<sub>night</sub>)) have been surpassed. The Directive neither sets limit values for noise exposure, nor prescribes measures for inclusion in the action plans. Finally, Member States are required to select and preserve areas of good acoustic environmental quality, referred to as quiet areas, in order to protect the European soundscape.</p> <p>High noise levels are defined in the 7th EAP as noise levels for L<sub>den</sub> above 55dB and for L<sub>night</sub> above 50dB. During the night, high noise levels can cause sleep disturbance, such as body movements and wakening, starting at L<sub>night</sub> levels below 40dB, and with effects on the cardiovascular system that become apparent above 55dB. All these impacts can contribute to premature mortality (WHO, 2009).</p> <p>The WHO established a night-time noise guideline for L<sub>night</sub> of 40dB for outside noise with the aim of protecting the public, including vulnerable groups such as children, the chronically ill and the elderly. An outside noise L<sub>night </sub>value of 55dB was recommended as an interim target for countries where the night-time noise guideline cannot be achieved in the short term and where policymakers adopt a stepwise approach. The WHO night-time noise guideline is stricter than the L<sub>night</sub> threshold of 50dB set under the END, providing a higher level of protection for human health. However, assessments cannot be made by comparing noise levels in Europe with WHO recommended levels, as Member States are not obliged to report this information.</p> <p>Figure 1 provides an overview of the number of people exposed to levels of environmental noise in Europe that are above the noise indicators set by the END within and outside urban areas. The major source of noise pollution (measured in terms of number of affected people), both inside and outside urban areas, is road traffic. Noise from trains and aircraft has a much lower impact in terms of overall population exposure to noise, but it remains the major source of localised noise pollution (EEA, 2015).</p> <p>More specifically, it is estimated that more than 125 million people in the EU are exposed to L<sub>den</sub> levels from road traffic noise that are above 55dB.<sub> </sub>Night-time road traffic is another major source of noise exposure, with over 83 million Europeans exposed to harmful L<sub>night</sub> levels above 50dB. In addition, many people are also exposed to rail, aircraft and industrial noise, particularly in towns and cities. While aircraft noise does not affect a wide geographical area, the effects extend beyond health impacts on nearby populations to direct effects on the ability of younger generations to concentrate in schools that are affected by aircraft flight paths.</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Figure 1.

However, it is widely acknowledged that the most effective actions to reduce exposure tend to be those that reduce noise at source, for example reducing the number of vehicles on the road, introducing quieter tyres for road vehicles or laying quieter road surfaces.</p> <p>A major problem for the effectiveness of such measures is that, given the different factors that determine traffic noise, a single measure alone is often not sufficient to significantly reduce exposure.</p> <p>Efforts to reduce the noise from individual sources tend to be offset by the higher numbers of people being exposed to high noise levels, due to increasing road and aviation traffic and increasing numbers of city inhabitants. Recent trends show a rise in car travel across the EU, with 77% of passenger-kilometres using car transport in 2013 compared with 65% in 2000 (EEA, 2015).

As the 2020 objective of healthy commercial fish populations applies to all marine waters, it is unlikely to be met           For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene    The 7th EAP stipulates that the EU shall ensure that by 2020 the impact of pressures on all marine waters is reduced to achieve or maintain GES, as required by the MSFD (EU, 2013a).  Fishing is one of the main pressures affecting the marine environment, in particular the state of commercial fish species. Ensuring healthy fish populations is essential for well-functioning ecosystems, but also to sustain fishing as a source of healthy food in the long term.    Policy targets and progress    Safeguarding healthy commercial fish populations is one of the 11 descriptors of the MSFD (EU, 2008) for achieving GES. This objective is closely related to the objectives of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) (EU, 2013b), in particular the objective of ensuring the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for all stocks by 2015 where possible, and at the latest by 2020.   Currently, around 58% of the assessed fish stocks in Europes seas are not in GES, whereas only 12% of fish stocks are in GES when assessing both the level of fishing mortality and reproductive capacity (EEA, 2015a). In addition, there are strong regional differences, as shown in Figure 1. The status of fish stocks is especially critical in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.       Figure 1. Status of fish stocks in regional seas around Europe          Note: This figure shows the proportion of assessed stocks per regional sea that are in good environmental status (GES). The numbers on the charts indicate the number of fish stocks. Status refers to fishing mortality (F) and reproductive capacity (SSB) criteria, as defined by the Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, which sets criteria and methodological standards on GES of marine waters. The GES criterion on healthy age- and size-distribution cannot be assessed at present. Stocks in the Northeast Atlantic and Baltic waters were assessed based on   advice   from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for 2013. Stocks in the Mediterranean and Black seas, and widely distributed stocks, were most recently assessed by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) respectively, which varied between 2008 and 2012.    Source:  Black Sea stock assessment ,  Mediterranean stock assessments ,  North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic sea stock assessments  Provided by  Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)     Moreover, a lack of information on the status of stocks was observed for a large (40%) proportion of fish stocks (EEA, 2015a). Figure 2 shows that there are also strong regional differences in terms of availability of information. An assessment of status is not possible for 68% of the total landings from the Mediterranean and Black Seas, compared with 35% of those from the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea (EEA, 2015b).    Figure 2. Proportion of fish landings with Good Environmental Status information            Note: This figure shows the proportion of commercial fish landings per regional sea with GES assessment information, as defined by Commission Decision 2010/477/EU, which sets criteria and methodological standards on the GES of marine waters. GES assessment information relates to fishing mortality (F) and reproductive capacity (SSB) criteria, since the criterion on healthy age- and size-distribution cannot be assessed at present. Landings data for all fish stocks are from 2010, given the availability of data for the Mediterranean and Black Seas.   Source:  Black Sea stock assessment ,  Mediterranean stock assessments ,  North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic sea stock assessments  Provided by    Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)  .   It is clear that the overall use of fish stocks in Europe currently remains beyond the limit for long-term environmental sustainability. Historical trends in fish landings show that total landings in Europes seas reached a peak in the mid-1970s, but have been mostly declining ever since (Pastoors and Poulsen, 2008; Gascuel et al., 2014). The observed consistent decrease in landings suggests that the overall levels of exploitation remain too high for ensuringhealthy populations of commercial fish.   Important signs of improvement are being observed in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. Since the early 2000s, better management of fish stocks has contributed to a clear decrease in fishing pressure in these two regional seas (EEA, 2015b; EC, 2015). Between 2002 and 2015, the number of stocks exploited at sustainable levels (i.e. fishing at or below MSY) increased from 2 to 26 (EC, 2015). Signs of recovery in the reproductive capacity of several fish stocks have started to appear (EEA, 2015a). If these efforts continue, meeting the 2020 objective for healthy fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea could be possible. In contrast, there is little likelihood that the 2020 policy objective will be met in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (EC, 2015). Given this, despite the EUs commitment to ensuring better governance for sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean region, the 2020 objective of healthy commercial fish populations is unlikely to be met for all marine waters and further collective action is required.    Outlook beyond 2020    Fishing management measures, when effectively implemented, can have a positive effect on the state of fish stocks, as can be seen in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. However, ensuring healthy fish populations does not depend solely on fishing at environmentally sustainable levels, although it is a necessary condition. Healthy fish populations depend on healthy marine ecosystems but, today, our use of Europes seas and their natural capital is not sustainable (EEA, 2015b). Europes marine ecosystems continue to display symptoms of degradation and loss of resilience, which will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. These systemic changes are still complex and to a large extent poorly understood, but they are closely linked to the loss of biodiversity. Without an integrated approach to the management and protection of Europes seas  which would make ecosystem-based management a reality, as required by both the MSFD and the CFP  the outlook beyond 2020 for productive seas and healthy fish populations calls for concern.    About the indicator    The indicator assesses the status of fish stocks in Europes regional seas, which represent the populations of commercial fish and shellfish species, in relation to their GES. The indicator also provides an overview of the availability of information to provide a GES analysis. The indicator follows the GES methodological standards as currently defined by Commission Decision 2010/477/EU (EC, 2010). It measures GES by assessing two criteria  the level of fishing mortality (i.e. fishing pressure) and the reproductive capacity of fish stocks (i.e. spawning stock biomass)  against their sustainable reference levels (i.e. MSY or a proxy). The third GES criterion on healthy age and size distribution cannot be assessed at present.

Historical trends in fish landings show that total landings in Europes seas reached a peak in the mid-1970s, but have been mostly declining ever since (Pastoors and Poulsen, 2008; Gascuel et al., 2014). The observed consistent decrease in landings suggests that the overall levels of exploitation remain too high for ensuringhealthy populations of commercial fish.</p> <p>Important signs of improvement are being observed in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. Since the early 2000s, better management of fish stocks has contributed to a clear decrease in fishing pressure in these two regional seas (EEA, 2015b; EC, 2015). Between 2002 and 2015, the number of stocks exploited at sustainable levels (i.e. fishing at or below MSY) increased from 2 to 26 (EC, 2015). Signs of recovery in the reproductive capacity of several fish stocks have started to appear (EEA, 2015a). If these efforts continue, meeting the 2020 objective for healthy fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea could be possible. In contrast, there is little likelihood that the 2020 policy objective will be met in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (EC, 2015). Given this, despite the EUs commitment to ensuring better governance for sustainable fisheries in the Mediterranean region, the 2020 objective of healthy commercial fish populations is unlikely to be met for all marine waters and further collective action is required.</p> <h2><span>Outlook beyond 2020</span></h2> <p>Fishing management measures, when effectively implemented, can have a positive effect on the state of fish stocks, as can be seen in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. However, ensuring healthy fish populations does not depend solely on fishing at environmentally sustainable levels, although it is a necessary condition. Healthy fish populations depend on healthy marine ecosystems but, today, our use of Europes seas and their natural capital is not sustainable (EEA, 2015b). Europes marine ecosystems continue to display symptoms of degradation and loss of resilience, which will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. These systemic changes are still complex and to a large extent poorly understood, but they are closely linked to the loss of biodiversity. Without an integrated approach to the management and protection of Europes seas  which would make ecosystem-based management a reality, as required by both the MSFD and the CFP  the outlook beyond 2020 for productive seas and healthy fish populations calls for concern.</p> <h2><span>About the indicator</span></h2> <p>The indicator assesses the status of fish stocks in Europes regional seas, which represent the populations of commercial fish and shellfish species, in relation to their GES. The indicator also provides an overview of the availability of information to provide a GES analysis. The indicator follows the GES methodological standards as currently defined by Commission Decision 2010/477/EU (EC, 2010). It measures GES by assessing two criteria  the level of fishing mortality (i.e. fishing pressure) and the reproductive capacity of fish stocks (i.e. spawning stock biomass)  against their sustainable reference levels (i.e. MSY or a proxy). The third GES criterion on healthy age and size distribution cannot be assessed at present. The indicator reflects the current level of implementation of the MSFD and data availability for an assessment at the EU level.</p>","Marine fish stocks",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP), in line with the Marine<b> </b>Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), requires the EU to meet its 2020 objective of achieving good environmental status (GES) of the marine environment, which means that the different uses made of Europes seas are conducted at a sustainable level. Fishing is one of the main pressures affecting GES, in particular the state of commercial fish species. Historically, fishing beyond sustainable levels has made it difficult to reach the objective of healthy fish populations. Currently, around 58% of fish stocks in Europes seas are not in GES. The situation has started to improve, albeit with strong regional differences. In the North-East Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea, clear signs of the recovery of fish stocks have been visible since the early 2000s. In the Mediterranean and Black Seas, the situation remains critical given the prevalence of overfishing and a significant lack of knowledge on the status of fish stocks. Given this context, the 2020 objective of healthy fish populations is unlikely to be met for all of Europes seas, and further collective action is required.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-24T14:46:03Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Czech Republic,Cyprus,Austria,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Belgium,Lithuania,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Water","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/natural-capital/marine-fish-stocks","Briefing (all)","2003,2015,2005,2017,2007,1991,2019,2009,1994,1992,2020,1998,2010,2000,2012,1996,2002,2014,2004,2016,2006,1990,2018,2008,1995,1993,2011,1999,2001,2013,1997","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

The rate of increase in resource productivity has been projected to return to the more gradual rate seen prior to the economic downturn of just below 1 % per year             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP priority objective 2 (EU, 2013) includes the objective that by 2020 the resource efficiency of the EU has to improve. Resource efficiency can lower environmental burdens by reducing the overall consumption of materials and other resources. It can also help to sustain economic development by securing the appropriate supply of resources and investments in innovation, while increasing global competitiveness (OECD, 2015). This briefing presents trends in resource productivity. Since resource productivity measures the quantity of economic output produced using a certain amount of extracted resources, it is used as a proxy for resource efficiency by the European Commission. It effectively measures the decoupling of material use from economic growth. However, under conditions of relative decoupling, overall material use can increase despite an increase in resource productivity.    Policy targets and progress    The Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative (EC, 2011a) of the Europe 2020 Strategy is aimed at promoting the decoupling of economic growth from resource use. Absolute decoupling means that resource use declines or remains stable under conditions of economic growth.   The broad objectives of the Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative are implemented by the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011b) whose goal is to ensure increasing economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources. Resource efficiency is viewed as the means to achieve this objective and resource productivity is the lead indicator for monitoring the progress of the actions in the roadmap. Neither the roadmap nor any other EU policy or strategy sets quantitative targets for improvements in resource productivity, although some Member States have adopted national targets (see country-level information section).   The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe committed the European Commission to discussing and agreeing on resource efficiency indicators and targets. The 7th EAP recognised that Resource efficiency indicators and targets  would provide the necessary guidance for public and private decision-makers in transforming the economy. Once agreed at Union level, such indicators and targets will become an integral part of the 7th EAP. While targets have not been defined to date, a set of indicators has been published since 2015 in the form of the Resource Efficiency Scoreboard (EC, 2015a).    Figure 1. Resource productivity, domestic material consumption (DMC) and gross domestic product (GDP) in the European Union             Although there were some fluctuations, 2000 to 2007 was a period during which material use (domestic material consumption, DMC) saw relative decoupling from economic growth (gross domestic product, GDP). In other words, material use grew but at a slower rate than the economy. Resource productivity for the EU as a whole increased by nearly 7 % over this period. The period from 2007 onwards is characterised by absolute decoupling, as material use has declined sharply.   Between 2008 and 2009, both material use and GDP decreased, although material use fell more rapidly than GDP. Since 2009, despite some return to economic growth, material use has continued to fall. The overall result of the trends in these two variables is that resource productivity increased by 35 % between 2000 and 2015, with most of the improvement occurring after 2008.   Europe appears to be extracting more value from the material resources it uses. While this is indeed a positive development, a closer look reveals that it would not be justified to attribute this entirely to the success of environmental policies. Other economic and technical factors seem to have played a role, including the changing structure of countries economies, the effect of the economic downturn, globalisation and increasing reliance on imports, and even the nature of the indicator itself (EEA, 2016).   There have been some improvements in the resource productivity of individual sectors. Since 2008, this has been dominated by the fact that the economic downturn affected the material-intensive industries of manufacturing and construction more than it affected services, which typically are less material intensive (Eurostat, 2015a).   The 19 % drop in total material use between 2007 and 2015 was largely due to a 29 % decline in the demand for non-metallic minerals (Figure 2). This was caused by a slump in the construction sector where gross value added (in chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) fell by almost 17 % over the same period (Eurostat, 2016a).    Figure 2. Domestic Material Consumption (DMC) by type of material, EU             A slowdown in construction activity can have significant implications for the resource productivity of the economy as a whole. In 2007, the construction sector was responsible for more than one third of total material use in the EU (Eurostat, 2016b) but contributed only 6.4 % of its total economic output (Eurostat, 2016a). Therefore, this sector had a low resource productivity compared with the economy as a whole. Any shrinkage in this sector, as occurred between 2007 and 2013, will therefore lead to an increase in the resource productivity of the whole economy. The same is true for the manufacturing industries.   There have also been some improvements in the resource productivity of some other sectors. A notable example is the decline in the consumption of fossil fuels since 2004. This decline accelerated immediately after the economic downturn and is also the result of an increasing shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and of overall improvements in energy efficiency in the economy as a whole (EEA, 2016). These latter developments can be expected to continue to 2020 and beyond in response to EU and national climate and energy policies.   A further cause of the underlying increase in resource productivity may be the long-term shift of the EU towards a service economy. Services increased their contribution to the EU economy from 71.5 % in 2003 to 73.5 % in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015b).   Detailed projections of material use within the four main material groups from 2012 to 2030 have been carried out for the European Commission. A wide range of factors was modelled, including technological developments, policy in energy and climate, agriculture, transport and the manufacturing sector, and demographic and economic trends. The modelling analysis projects a 0.7 % rise in material use per year but a higher rate of growth in GDP, resulting in a 0.9 % increase in resource productivity per year (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). This is similar to the rate observed between 2000 and 2008. The projections would suggest that the 7th EAP 2020 objective of increasing resource efficiency should be met.    Country-level information    Resource productivity varies between countries by a factor of nearly 20. This variation is not a sign of more efficient industry in one country compared with another, but rather a reflection of the types of material resources available in the country and its economic structures. Countries with service-based economies will tend to have higher resource productivity than economies with a high proportion of heavy industry, since service industries typically have a lower demand for material inputs (EEA, 2013).           Figure 3.  Resource productivity by country         Note: 2013 is the latest year for Norway and Serbia. Resource productivity is measured in Euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per kilogram of domestic material consumption (euroCLV2010/kg DMC).   Countries with the highest resource productivity in the EU are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, with values around EUR 3.5/kg. Resource productivity improved in all but three Member States between 2000 and 2015. The exceptions were Estonia, Malta and Romania. For many countries, gains in resource productivity have been most prominent since 2008. These have again largely been caused by a drop in the demand for non-metallic minerals, as a result of a post-downturn slump in the construction sector, and to longer term reductions in the consumption of fossil fuel carriers. The countries that experienced the sharpest decline in material use for non-metallic minerals between 2007 and 2015 were Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, ranging from a 75 % reduction in the case of Spain to a 42 % reduction in the case of Portugal.   It is hard to determine whether policy has had an effect or not. Only three countries (Austria, Finland and Germany) and two sub-national regions (Flanders and Scotland) have adopted dedicated strategies for resource efficiency. A number of other countries incorporate resource productivity concepts into other strategies and policies, including those on waste, energy and industrial development, or national reform programmes (EEA, 2016). National efforts to improve resource productivity are based on a mixture of economic and environmental considerations. The most prominent factors are the need to increase competitiveness and to secure access to raw materials and energy (or reduce reliance on imports), while lowering pressures on the environment. In addition, a number of European countries have already developed, or are planning to develop, national raw material strategies (EEA, 2016).   Moreover, nine EU Member States (Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia) have adopted resource productivity targets (as of December 2015). These vary somewhat in their scope, format and timeframes, but all aim to achieve improvements in resource productivity. It is difficult to compare the ambitions of these targets between countries because of the varying time periods over which they have to be achieved and the different starting levels in terms of resource productivity (Figure 3). With the exception of Germany, all countries targets were adopted after the economic downturn and most since 2012. The effects of Member State targets and policies may become evident only during the second half of the decade.   Improving resource productivity has not necessarily led to reduced overall material use. Of the 25 EU Member States whose resource productivity improved between 2000 and 2015, eight (Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden) have, nevertheless, experienced an increase in demand for materials of between 19 % and 46 % over the same period. The three countries (Estonia, Malta and Romania) that did not achieve improvements in resource productivity saw even higher increases in material use. Romania, Estonia and Maltas material use rose by 168 %, 104 % and 60 %, respectively (Eurostat, 2016b). In general, policies and targets for reducing overall material use are far less common than those aimed at increasing resource productivity.    Outlook beyond 2020    The long-term vision of the 7th EAP includes the goal that Europes growth should be decoupled from resource use. This means not only improvements in resource productivity, but also absolute reductions in material use.   The EU has been forecast, under certain conditions, to increase its resource productivity by 14 % between 2014 and 2030 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). Through specific policies to promote the transition to a more circular economy, as called for by the  European Resource Efficiency Platform   , this rate could possibly double. While contributing significantly to the sustainability dimension of growth, increasing resource productivity by 30 % would also have a positive impact on job creation and GDP growth (EC, 2014b).    Industry already recognises the strong business case for improving resource productivity. It is estimated that resource efficiency improvements along the whole value chain could reduce the need for material inputs by 17  24 % by 2030 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). Better use of resources could represent an overall savings potential of EUR 630 billion per year for the European manufacturing industry (INNOVA, 2012).   Of the nine countries that have adopted resource productivity targets, five include targets beyond 2020: Austria, France, Latvia, Portugal and Slovenia. Austria aims to achieve a four- to ten-fold increase in resource productivity over 2008 levels by 2050. Such ambitious targets and a more resource-efficient EU will require further fundamental changes in production and consumption patterns. The adoption of the Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015a) and recent efforts by some countries to analyse their material resource availability and needs, and to develop raw material strategies, demonstrate that Member States are changing their approach towards the use of materials.          About the indicator          Resource productivity is measured here as the economic output (GDP) in euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per unit weight (kilograms) of material use (DMC). DMC comprises the consumption of fossil energy carriers, biomass, metal ores and non-metallic minerals, such as sand and gravel, used in construction. DMC is measured as the used weight of domestically extracted material, plus the direct weight of imports, minus the direct weight of exports.   A potential weakness of using DMC in a resource productivity indicator is that DMC excludes the raw materials extracted in non-EU countries and embedded in imported goods. An alternative to DMC as a resource productivity indicator is raw material consumption (RMC). RMC presents the import and export flows expressed in their raw material equivalents. These are currently estimated with models and are still under development. RMC has been developed by Eurostat for the EU-27 but is not yet available for individual Member States. In contrast, DMC is available for all Member States, has a long time series and is disaggregated into material components.   Both DMC and RMC have their weaknesses as proxies for environmental pressures caused by material use. All material types are given equal significance when compiling DMC. This is despite large differences in scarcity and the impacts caused per kilogram by the extraction of different types of material and use, e.g. gravel versus mercury. Moreover, DMC and RMC have exhibited similar trends since at least 2002, and therefore the choice of one or the other will have had little effect on trends to date in resource productivity (EEA, 2015; Figure 2).,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td width='60'> <p><b>EU indicator pasttrend</b></p> <p></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p><b>Selected objective to be met by 2020</b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><strong>Indicative outlook</strong><br /><strong>of the EU meeting</strong><br /><strong>the selected</strong><br /><strong>objective by 2020</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p></p> <p>Resource productivity</p> </td> <td width='60'> <p align='center'><em><br /></em></p> <p align='center'><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></em></p> <p></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p align='center'>Improve economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources  Roadmap to a resource efficient Europe<b></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><br /></em></p> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-improving-trend/@@images/c8cc1b37-a982-43d2-b412-51f638dd7b66.jpeg' alt='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' title='Green circle: it is likely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> <p></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>There was a decline in the use of materials and a rapid rate of increase in resource productivity following the economic downturn of 2007/2008.

However, under conditions of relative decoupling, overall material use can increase despite an increase in resource productivity.</p> <h2><span>Policy targets and progress</span></h2> <p>The Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative (EC, 2011a) of the Europe 2020 Strategy is aimed at promoting the decoupling of economic growth from resource use. Absolute decoupling means that resource use declines or remains stable under conditions of economic growth.</p> <p>The broad objectives of the Resource-efficient Europe flagship initiative are implemented by the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011b) whose goal is to ensure increasing economic performance while reducing pressure on natural resources. Resource efficiency is viewed as the means to achieve this objective and resource productivity is the lead indicator for monitoring the progress of the actions in the roadmap. Neither the roadmap nor any other EU policy or strategy sets quantitative targets for improvements in resource productivity, although some Member States have adopted national targets (see country-level information section).</p> <p>The Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe committed the European Commission to discussing and agreeing on resource efficiency indicators and targets. The 7th EAP recognised that Resource efficiency indicators and targets  would provide the necessary guidance for public and private decision-makers in transforming the economy. Once agreed at Union level, such indicators and targets will become an integral part of the 7th EAP. While targets have not been defined to date, a set of indicators has been published since 2015 in the form of the Resource Efficiency Scoreboard (EC, 2015a).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Figure 1.

In other words, material use grew but at a slower rate than the economy. Resource productivity for the EU as a whole increased by nearly 7 % over this period. The period from 2007 onwards is characterised by absolute decoupling, as material use has declined sharply.</p> <p>Between 2008 and 2009, both material use and GDP decreased, although material use fell more rapidly than GDP. Since 2009, despite some return to economic growth, material use has continued to fall. The overall result of the trends in these two variables is that resource productivity increased by 35 % between 2000 and 2015, with most of the improvement occurring after 2008.</p> <p>Europe appears to be extracting more value from the material resources it uses. While this is indeed a positive development, a closer look reveals that it would not be justified to attribute this entirely to the success of environmental policies. Other economic and technical factors seem to have played a role, including the changing structure of countries economies, the effect of the economic downturn, globalisation and increasing reliance on imports, and even the nature of the indicator itself (EEA, 2016).</p> <p>There have been some improvements in the resource productivity of individual sectors. Since 2008, this has been dominated by the fact that the economic downturn affected the material-intensive industries of manufacturing and construction more than it affected services, which typically are less material intensive (Eurostat, 2015a).</p> <p>The 19 % drop in total material use between 2007 and 2015 was largely due to a 29 % decline in the demand for non-metallic minerals (Figure 2). This was caused by a slump in the construction sector where gross value added (in chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) fell by almost 17 % over the same period (Eurostat, 2016a).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Figure 2.

In 2007, the construction sector was responsible for more than one third of total material use in the EU (Eurostat, 2016b) but contributed only 6.4 % of its total economic output (Eurostat, 2016a). Therefore, this sector had a low resource productivity compared with the economy as a whole. Any shrinkage in this sector, as occurred between 2007 and 2013, will therefore lead to an increase in the resource productivity of the whole economy. The same is true for the manufacturing industries.</p> <p>There have also been some improvements in the resource productivity of some other sectors. A notable example is the decline in the consumption of fossil fuels since 2004. This decline accelerated immediately after the economic downturn and is also the result of an increasing shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy and of overall improvements in energy efficiency in the economy as a whole (EEA, 2016). These latter developments can be expected to continue to 2020 and beyond in response to EU and national climate and energy policies.</p> <p>A further cause of the underlying increase in resource productivity may be the long-term shift of the EU towards a service economy. Services increased their contribution to the EU economy from 71.5 % in 2003 to 73.5 % in 2013 (Eurostat, 2015b).</p> <p>Detailed projections of material use within the four main material groups from 2012 to 2030 have been carried out for the European Commission. A wide range of factors was modelled, including technological developments, policy in energy and climate, agriculture, transport and the manufacturing sector, and demographic and economic trends. The modelling analysis projects a 0.7 % rise in material use per year but a higher rate of growth in GDP, resulting in a 0.9 % increase in resource productivity per year (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). This is similar to the rate observed between 2000 and 2008. The projections would suggest that the 7th EAP 2020 objective of increasing resource efficiency should be met.</p> <h2><span>Country-level information</span></h2> <p>Resource productivity varies between countries by a factor of nearly 20. This variation is not a sign of more efficient industry in one country compared with another, but rather a reflection of the types of material resources available in the country and its economic structures. Countries with service-based economies will tend to have higher resource productivity than economies with a high proportion of heavy industry, since service industries typically have a lower demand for material inputs (EEA, 2013).<span></span></p> <div class='pageBreak'><span><br /></span></div> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 3. <span class='erratum-header-text'>Resource productivity by country</span></h4> <p><iframe height='739' src='../../../../data-and-maps/daviz/resource-productivity-gdp-dmc-3/embed-chart?chart=chart_1&amp;chartWidth=603&amp;chartHeight=671&amp;customStyle=.googlechart_view%7Bmargin-left%3A0px%3B%7D.googlechart-notes%7Bdisplay%3Anone%7D&amp;skipdaviztitle=true&amp;skipcharttitle=true&amp;padding=12%2C89%2C62%2C116#_filters=%7B%22rowFilters%22%3A%7B%7D%3B%22columnFilters%22%3A%7B%22pre_config_date%22%3A%5B2000%3B2008%3B2015%5D%7D%3B%22sortFilter%22%3A%5B%22tsdpc100_2015_reversed%22%5D%3B%22hideFilters%22%3A%5B%22googlechart_filters_sortfilter_custom_filter%22%3B%22googlechart_filters_pre_config_filter_date_custom_filter%22%5D%7D' width='605'></iframe></p> <p class='callout'><strong>Note:</strong> 2013 is the latest year for Norway and Serbia. Resource productivity is measured in Euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per kilogram of domestic material consumption (euroCLV2010/kg DMC).</p> <p>Countries with the highest resource productivity in the EU are the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, with values around EUR 3.5/kg. Resource productivity improved in all but three Member States between 2000 and 2015. The exceptions were Estonia, Malta and Romania. For many countries, gains in resource productivity have been most prominent since 2008. These have again largely been caused by a drop in the demand for non-metallic minerals, as a result of a post-downturn slump in the construction sector, and to longer term reductions in the consumption of fossil fuel carriers. The countries that experienced the sharpest decline in material use for non-metallic minerals between 2007 and 2015 were Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain, ranging from a 75 % reduction in the case of Spain to a 42 % reduction in the case of Portugal.</p> <p>It is hard to determine whether policy has had an effect or not. Only three countries (Austria, Finland and Germany) and two sub-national regions (Flanders and Scotland) have adopted dedicated strategies for resource efficiency. A number of other countries incorporate resource productivity concepts into other strategies and policies, including those on waste, energy and industrial development, or national reform programmes (EEA, 2016). National efforts to improve resource productivity are based on a mixture of economic and environmental considerations. The most prominent factors are the need to increase competitiveness and to secure access to raw materials and energy (or reduce reliance on imports), while lowering pressures on the environment. In addition, a number of European countries have already developed, or are planning to develop, national raw material strategies (EEA, 2016).</p> <p>Moreover, nine EU Member States (Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia) have adopted resource productivity targets (as of December 2015). These vary somewhat in their scope, format and timeframes, but all aim to achieve improvements in resource productivity. It is difficult to compare the ambitions of these targets between countries because of the varying time periods over which they have to be achieved and the different starting levels in terms of resource productivity (Figure 3). With the exception of Germany, all countries targets were adopted after the economic downturn and most since 2012. The effects of Member State targets and policies may become evident only during the second half of the decade.</p> <p>Improving resource productivity has not necessarily led to reduced overall material use. Of the 25 EU Member States whose resource productivity improved between 2000 and 2015, eight (Bulgaria, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden) have, nevertheless, experienced an increase in demand for materials of between 19 % and 46 % over the same period. The three countries (Estonia, Malta and Romania) that did not achieve improvements in resource productivity saw even higher increases in material use. Romania, Estonia and Maltas material use rose by 168 %, 104 % and 60 %, respectively (Eurostat, 2016b). In general, policies and targets for reducing overall material use are far less common than those aimed at increasing resource productivity.</p> <h2><span>Outlook beyond 2020</span></h2> <p>The long-term vision of the 7th EAP includes the goal that Europes growth should be decoupled from resource use. This means not only improvements in resource productivity, but also absolute reductions in material use.</p> <p>The EU has been forecast, under certain conditions, to increase its resource productivity by 14 % between 2014 and 2030 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). Through specific policies to promote the transition to a more circular economy, as called for by the <a class='external-link' href='http://ec.europa.eu/environment/resource_efficiency/re_platform/index_en.htm' target='_self' title=''>European Resource Efficiency Platform</a><span></span>,<span>this rate could possibly double. While contributing significantly to the sustainability dimension of growth, increasing resource productivity by 30 % would also have a positive impact on job creation and GDP growth (EC, 2014b).</span></p> <p>Industry already recognises the strong business case for improving resource productivity. It is estimated that resource efficiency improvements along the whole value chain could reduce the need for material inputs by 17  24 % by 2030 (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014). Better use of resources could represent an overall savings potential of EUR 630 billion per year for the European manufacturing industry (INNOVA, 2012).</p> <p>Of the nine countries that have adopted resource productivity targets, five include targets beyond 2020: Austria, France, Latvia, Portugal and Slovenia. Austria aims to achieve a four- to ten-fold increase in resource productivity over 2008 levels by 2050. Such ambitious targets and a more resource-efficient EU will require further fundamental changes in production and consumption patterns. The adoption of the Circular Economy Package (EC, 2015a) and recent efforts by some countries to analyse their material resource availability and needs, and to develop raw material strategies, demonstrate that Member States are changing their approach towards the use of materials.</p> <div> <div> <div> <h2><span>About the indicator</span></h2> </div> </div> <div> <p>Resource productivity is measured here as the economic output (GDP) in euros (chain-linked volumes, reference year 2010) per unit weight (kilograms) of material use (DMC). DMC comprises the consumption of fossil energy carriers, biomass, metal ores and non-metallic minerals, such as sand and gravel, used in construction. DMC is measured as the used weight of domestically extracted material, plus the direct weight of imports, minus the direct weight of exports.</p> <p>A potential weakness of using DMC in a resource productivity indicator is that DMC excludes the raw materials extracted in non-EU countries and embedded in imported goods. An alternative to DMC as a resource productivity indicator is raw material consumption (RMC). RMC presents the import and export flows expressed in their raw material equivalents. These are currently estimated with models and are still under development. RMC has been developed by Eurostat for the EU-27 but is not yet available for individual Member States. In contrast, DMC is available for all Member States, has a long time series and is disaggregated into material components.</p> <p>Both DMC and RMC have their weaknesses as proxies for environmental pressures caused by material use. All material types are given equal significance when compiling DMC. This is despite large differences in scarcity and the impacts caused per kilogram by the extraction of different types of material and use, e.g. gravel versus mercury. Moreover, DMC and RMC have exhibited similar trends since at least 2002, and therefore the choice of one or the other will have had little effect on trends to date in resource productivity (EEA, 2015; Figure 2).</p> <p></p> </div> </div>","Resource efficiency",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes the objective that by 2020 resource efficiency has to improve.

Most of this increase occurred after 2008.

However, on average, the EU still has an unacceptable level of nitrogen losses from agricultural land to the environment and further efforts are needed to manage the nutrient cycle for nitrogen sustainably in the EU             For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the  EEA Environmental indicator report 2016      Setting the Scene   The 7th EAP (EU, 2013) calls for further efforts to manage the nutrient cycle in a more sustainable way and to improve efficiency in the use of fertilisers. Excessive nutrient losses affect soil, air and water quality, have a negative impact on ecosystems and have the potential to cause significant problems for human health. This nutrient pollution also results in significant economic losses and increased costs for society (e.g. in relation to tourism and recreation, human health and drinking water treatment). If not applied correctly (e.g. taking account of weather conditions, stage of crop growth, dosage, etc.), fertilisers cause excess nutrients to be released to the wider environment by run-off into surface water ( AIRS_PO1.9, 2016 ). 1  or leaching into groundwater. Eutrophication caused by excess nutrients can result in increases in weeds and algae, reduced oxygen levels and subsequent biodiversity loss. These impacts can be reduced by balancing nutrient inputs with the outputs of the agricultural system (i.e. nutrients contained in grazed and harvested crops) in order to limit nutrient losses to the environment. Both nitrogen and phosphorus are important sources of nutrient pollution, although, nitrogen losses are currently the most significant nutrient losses, in particular from agricultural production that have a negative impact on ecosystems. Therefore, this briefing focuses on the nitrogen balance in agricultural land.   Policy targets and progress   There are no environmental acquis objectives that match the 7th EAP objective of managing the nutrient cycle in a more cost-effective, sustainable and resource-efficient way. Nevertheless, several directives relate to the nutrient cycle. The EU Nitrates Directive (EU, 1991) aims to reduce water pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources and prevent pollution of ground and surface waters. To achieve this, the Directive sets legally binding maximum concentrations of nitrates in drinking water, limits the annual application of nitrogen fertiliser and livestock manure and designates periods during which nitrogen application is prohibited. There are several other EU directives that are relevant to the impact of excessive nutrient use in agriculture, namely the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) through its legal obligation to protect and restore the quality of all inland and coastal waters across Europe, the Directive on Sewage Sludge (EU, 1986) through its regulation of the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, as well as legal instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which encompass environmental requirements (cross-compliance) and targeted environmental measures that form part of the Rural Development Programmes. Achieving a gross nutrient balance that implies acceptable losses to the environment, although not a stated aim of these directives, is a key contributor to achieving some of the aims of these directives.   In the period between 2000 and 2013, the gross balance between nitrogen added to and removed from agricultural land in the EU showed an improving trend (Figure 1), meaning that the gap between inputs and outputs is closing and, therefore, the overall nitrogen balance is improving. The surplus of nitrogen applied to agricultural land fell by about 19%, from 63kg per hectare in 2000 to51kg per hectare in 2013 (Figure 1).   The causes of these improvements include nitrogen management practices; of these, the most important are changes in fertiliser application techniques (Eurostat, 2015) as a result of the implementation of specific measures of the Common Agricultural Policy and EU legislation.   Figure 1. Gross nitrogenbalance, EU        Assessing whether the nitrogen cycle is managed sustainably holds many challenges, and determining a sustainable level of nitrogen balance is not trivial. A zero balance for nitrogen might not be realistic because of the inevitable losses of nitrogen to air (mainly ammonia) and water (mainly nitrate). The main focus should be on reducing losses to the minimum level possible  for instance through resource-efficient agricultural practices  and on reaching a better understanding of acceptable losses of these nitrogen compounds to the environment. This can be estimated through a critical loads (inputs) approach, which is a quantitative estimate of the upper limit of pollution exposure at which harmful effects to the environment (water, ecosystems, species) can be avoided. Work is ongoing to improve our understanding of critical loads for the EUs ecosystems (EEA, forthcoming).   When considering critical loads of nitrogen in surface water and in air with respect to biodiversity (habitat quality) in 2010 (EEA, 2015a; EEA, forthcoming), the amounts of nitrogen applied to the system were found to still substantially exceed acceptable inputs and related losses, despite the decreasing trend in the nitrogen balance. This is confirmed by the reported eutrophication pressure on the EUs protected species and habitats (EEA, 2015b) ( AIRS_PO1.7, 2016 ) 2 , ( AIRS_PO1.8, 2016 ). 3    Reductions in fertiliser use and livestock numbers are helping to improve the nitrogen balance, but agriculture remains an important source of nitrogen in surface waters (EU, 2010). Agriculture, particularly runoff from agricultural land, is typically contributing 50  80% of the total nitrogen load in European surface waters (EEA, 2005), affecting nitrogen levels in freshwater (EEA, 2015c) and transitional, coastal and marine waters (EEA, 2015d). Mineral fertilisers deliver on average slightly more than 45% of the nitrogen input in the EU, while nearly 40% comes from organic fertilisers, i.e. manure (EEA, forthcoming).   Within the EU, mineral fertilisers are applied to agricultural soils mainly as straight nitrogen fertilisers in the form of ammonium nitrate. Since the 1990s, although the total agricultural surface area has decreased, the area of certain crops that receive high application rates of ammonium nitrate, such as wheat and oilseed rape, has increased. Nitrogen in mineral fertilisers is particularly soluble to facilitate uptake by crops, but this also makes it susceptible to run-off following heavy rainfall and to leaching to groundwater (Eurostat, 1999). In countries with intensive livestock production, critical losses to water and air (with related effects on biodiversity) occur predominantly as a result of excess manure inputs (EEA, forthcoming). Manure inputs, in particular, contribute to ammonia (NH 3 -N) emissions.   In conclusion, overall, the agricultural nitrogen balance shows an improving trend. However, on average, the EU still has an unacceptable surplus of nitrogen in agricultural land in relation to losses to the environment, so further efforts are needed to manage the nutrient cycle for nitrogen in a sustainable way in the EU.   Country level information   Agricultural nitrogen balances show an improvement from 2000 to 2013 in the majority of European countries, with the exception of some countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Slovakia (Figure 2).   Figure 2. Gross nitrogen balance, by country        In most countries, implementation of the Nitrates Directive and other agricultural improvements has tended to stabilise or reduce nitrogen inputs, potentially reducing environmental pressures (Eurostat, 2015).   Although decreasing in most Member States, agricultural nitrogen surpluses are still high in some parts of Europe, in particular in Western Europe and in some Mediterranean countries. Even in countries with low national averages, there can be regions with high loadings, depending on agricultural intensity, including livestock density.   Outlook beyond 2020   Future trends in the use of mineral fertilisers will depend on a number of factors, in particular on future EU agricultural and environmental policies. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), while fertiliser use is set to decline marginally in western Europe until 2018, it is set to increase in central and eastern Europe, mainly because of an increase in ammonia production capacity (ammonia is used to produce fertilisers) in eastern Europe (FAO, 2015), which is likely to increase fertiliser production, with the subsequent risks of excessive nutrient application.   Some of the actions likely to influence nutrient use in EU countries result from further uptake of agri-environmental measures that focus on the reduction of inputs. These include measures to further implement the Nitrates Directive and increased use of soil sampling and fertiliser advice programmes to encourage the trend towards optimal application.   About the indicator   The indicator estimates the potential surplus (or deficit) of nitrogen in agricultural land. It calculates the balance between nitrogen added to an agricultural system and nitrogen removed from the system annually in kilograms of nitrogen per hectare of agricultural land. The input side of the balance counts mineral fertiliser application and manure excretion as well as atmospheric deposition, biological fixation and biosolids (compost, sludge and sewage) input, while the output side of the balance represents the removal from grassland (grazing and mowing) and the net crop uptake (removal) from arable land. The gross nitrogen balance takes an extended soil surface or land surface as the system boundary, meaning that it also includes the nitrogen losses from animal housing and manure management (e.g. storage) systems.   The data used are partly based on experts estimates of various physical parameters for the country as a whole. Differing assumptions mean that the balances should only be considered as consistent within a country and that comparison between countries should be made with caution. There may also be large regional variations within a country, and therefore national figures should be interpreted with care. In fact, gross nitrogen balance calculations are available up to NUTS 3 level (NUTS is the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). Further downscaling is possible but introduces additional uncertainty in the data. Nevertheless, higher resolution data provide an insight into the variations and intensity of regional and local nitrogen losses, and subsequent negative impacts on regional and local ecosystems and biodiversity.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td> <p><b>EU indicator past trend </b></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020 </b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Gross nutrient balance in agricultural land: nitrogen</p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: center; '><img alt='Improving trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' title='Green: improving trend' /></p> <p align='center'></p> </td> <td> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Manage the nutrient cycle in a more sustainable way (nitrogen)  7th EAP</p> </td> <td style='text-align: center; '><img alt='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/red-deteriorating-trend/@@images/fcac20d8-04d3-444c-a2e0-ede1696479f5.jpeg' title='Red circle: it is unlikely that the objective will be met by 2020' /></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='4' width='712'> <p>Overall, the agricultural nitrogen balance shows an improving trend.

Both nitrogen and phosphorus are important sources of nutrient pollution, although, nitrogen losses are currently the most significant nutrient losses, in particular from agricultural production that have a negative impact on ecosystems. Therefore, this briefing focuses on the nitrogen balance in agricultural land.</p>&#13; <h2>Policy targets and progress</h2>&#13; <p>There are no environmental acquis objectives that match the 7th EAP objective of managing the nutrient cycle in a more cost-effective, sustainable and resource-efficient way. Nevertheless, several directives relate to the nutrient cycle. The EU Nitrates Directive (EU, 1991) aims to reduce water pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources and prevent pollution of ground and surface waters. To achieve this, the Directive sets legally binding maximum concentrations of nitrates in drinking water, limits the annual application of nitrogen fertiliser and livestock manure and designates periods during which nitrogen application is prohibited. There are several other EU directives that are relevant to the impact of excessive nutrient use in agriculture, namely the EU Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) through its legal obligation to protect and restore the quality of all inland and coastal waters across Europe, the Directive on Sewage Sludge (EU, 1986) through its regulation of the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, as well as legal instruments of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which encompass environmental requirements (cross-compliance) and targeted environmental measures that form part of the Rural Development Programmes. Achieving a gross nutrient balance that implies acceptable losses to the environment, although not a stated aim of these directives, is a key contributor to achieving some of the aims of these directives.</p>&#13; <p>In the period between 2000 and 2013, the gross balance between nitrogen added to and removed from agricultural land in the EU showed an improving trend (Figure 1), meaning that the gap between inputs and outputs is closing and, therefore, the overall nitrogen balance is improving. The surplus of nitrogen applied to agricultural land fell by about 19%, from 63kg per hectare in 2000 to51kg per hectare in 2013 (Figure 1).</p>&#13; <p>The causes of these improvements include nitrogen management practices; of these, the most important are changes in fertiliser application techniques (Eurostat, 2015) as a result of the implementation of specific measures of the Common Agricultural Policy and EU legislation.</p>&#13; <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 1.

A zero balance for nitrogen might not be realistic because of the inevitable losses of nitrogen to air (mainly ammonia) and water (mainly nitrate). The main focus should be on reducing losses to the minimum level possible  for instance through resource-efficient agricultural practices  and on reaching a better understanding of acceptable losses of these nitrogen compounds to the environment. This can be estimated through a critical loads (inputs) approach, which is a quantitative estimate of the upper limit of pollution exposure at which harmful effects to the environment (water, ecosystems, species) can be avoided. Work is ongoing to improve our understanding of critical loads for the EUs ecosystems (EEA, forthcoming).</p>&#13; <p>When considering critical loads of nitrogen in surface water and in air with respect to biodiversity (habitat quality) in 2010 (EEA, 2015a; EEA, forthcoming), the amounts of nitrogen applied to the system were found to still substantially exceed acceptable inputs and related losses, despite the decreasing trend in the nitrogen balance. This is confirmed by the reported eutrophication pressure on the EUs protected species and habitats (EEA, 2015b) (<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/natural-capital/eu-protected-species' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO1.7, 2016</a>)<sup>2</sup>, (<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/natural-capital/eu-protected-habitats' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO1.8, 2016</a>).<sup>3</sup></p>&#13; <p>Reductions in fertiliser use and livestock numbers are helping to improve the nitrogen balance, but agriculture remains an important source of nitrogen in surface waters (EU, 2010). Agriculture, particularly runoff from agricultural land, is typically contributing 50  80% of the total nitrogen load in European surface waters (EEA, 2005), affecting nitrogen levels in freshwater (EEA, 2015c) and transitional, coastal and marine waters (EEA, 2015d). Mineral fertilisers deliver on average slightly more than 45% of the nitrogen input in the EU, while nearly 40% comes from organic fertilisers, i.e. manure (EEA, forthcoming).</p>&#13; <p>Within the EU, mineral fertilisers are applied to agricultural soils mainly as straight nitrogen fertilisers in the form of ammonium nitrate. Since the 1990s, although the total agricultural surface area has decreased, the area of certain crops that receive high application rates of ammonium nitrate, such as wheat and oilseed rape, has increased. Nitrogen in mineral fertilisers is particularly soluble to facilitate uptake by crops, but this also makes it susceptible to run-off following heavy rainfall and to leaching to groundwater (Eurostat, 1999). In countries with intensive livestock production, critical losses to water and air (with related effects on biodiversity) occur predominantly as a result of excess manure inputs (EEA, forthcoming). Manure inputs, in particular, contribute to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>-N) emissions.</p>&#13; <p>In conclusion, overall, the agricultural nitrogen balance shows an improving trend. However, on average, the EU still has an unacceptable surplus of nitrogen in agricultural land in relation to losses to the environment, so further efforts are needed to manage the nutrient cycle for nitrogen in a sustainable way in the EU.</p>&#13; <h2>Country level information</h2>&#13; <p>Agricultural nitrogen balances show an improvement from 2000 to 2013 in the majority of European countries, with the exception of some countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Slovakia (Figure 2).</p>&#13; <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 2.

Even in countries with low national averages, there can be regions with high loadings, depending on agricultural intensity, including livestock density.</p>&#13; <h2>Outlook beyond 2020</h2>&#13; <p>Future trends in the use of mineral fertilisers will depend on a number of factors, in particular on future EU agricultural and environmental policies. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), while fertiliser use is set to decline marginally in western Europe until 2018, it is set to increase in central and eastern Europe, mainly because of an increase in ammonia production capacity (ammonia is used to produce fertilisers) in eastern Europe (FAO, 2015), which is likely to increase fertiliser production, with the subsequent risks of excessive nutrient application.</p>&#13; <p>Some of the actions likely to influence nutrient use in EU countries result from further uptake of agri-environmental measures that focus on the reduction of inputs. These include measures to further implement the Nitrates Directive and increased use of soil sampling and fertiliser advice programmes to encourage the trend towards optimal application.</p>&#13; <h2>About the indicator</h2>&#13; <p>The indicator estimates the potential surplus (or deficit) of nitrogen in agricultural land. It calculates the balance between nitrogen added to an agricultural system and nitrogen removed from the system annually in kilograms of nitrogen per hectare of agricultural land. The input side of the balance counts mineral fertiliser application and manure excretion as well as atmospheric deposition, biological fixation and biosolids (compost, sludge and sewage) input, while the output side of the balance represents the removal from grassland (grazing and mowing) and the net crop uptake (removal) from arable land. The gross nitrogen balance takes an extended soil surface or land surface as the system boundary, meaning that it also includes the nitrogen losses from animal housing and manure management (e.g. storage) systems.</p>&#13; <p>The data used are partly based on experts estimates of various physical parameters for the country as a whole. Differing assumptions mean that the balances should only be considered as consistent within a country and that comparison between countries should be made with caution. There may also be large regional variations within a country, and therefore national figures should be interpreted with care. In fact, gross nitrogen balance calculations are available up to NUTS 3 level (NUTS is the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics). Further downscaling is possible but introduces additional uncertainty in the data. Nevertheless, higher resolution data provide an insight into the variations and intensity of regional and local nitrogen losses, and subsequent negative impacts on regional and local ecosystems and biodiversity.</p>","Agricultural land: nitrogen balance",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) calls for further efforts to manage the nutrient cycle in a more sustainable way and to improve efficiency in the use of fertilisers. Currently, nitrogen losses from agricultural land, namely from fertiliser use, to the environment have a significant negative impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. These nitrogen losses to the environment in the EU have decreased considerably over the period examined (20002011), with expected positive effects on soil, water and air quality and, consequently, on biota and ecosystems.

This briefing presents trends in the use of freshwater resources. Water is an input to key economic sectors such as agriculture, tourism and industry, and it is an essential component for preserving biodiversity and maintaining other freshwater ecosystem services such as public water supply. It is therefore important that water use (as measured by the Water Exploitation Index plus (WEI+)) respects the limits of available renewable freshwater resources and that water stress be prevented or significantly reduced.    Policy targets and progress    The EUs Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) includes a milestone for 2020 that water abstraction should stay below 20% of available renewable freshwater resources. As quantity and quality of water are closely linked, achieving good status under the Water Framework Directive (see  Surface waters briefing, AIRS_PO1.9, 2016 ) 1  also requires ensuring that there is no overexploitation of water resources.   While freshwater is relatively abundant in Europe (EEA, 2015), water availability and socio-economic activity are unevenly distributed, leading to major differences in water stress levels across the continent. Except in some northern and sparsely populated areas that possess abundant freshwater resources, water stress occurs during the summer months in many areas of Europe, in particular in densely populated areas and the Mediterranean (Figure 1). Almost 17% of total renewable freshwater resources are abstracted in those regions, which are confronted with a difficult combination of a severe lack of freshwater and a high demand for it.   Figure 1. Water Exploitation Index plus for Europe, 2014           Source:  a)  The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR), Member States reporting under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 , b)  Waterbase - UWWTD: Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive  reported data , c)  Waterbase - Water Quantity , d)   European catchments and Rivers network system (Ecrins) .     Note:   The Water Exploitation Index Plus has been calculated at the sub basin scale on seasonal resolution and then aggregated to river basin district scale. The reference year is 2014 (Q1: January, February, March; Q2: April, May, June; Q3: July, August, September; Q4: October, November, December). The spatial reference data used when estimating the WEI+ is the ECRINS (European catchments and rivers network system). The ECRINS delineation of sub basin and river basin district differ from those defined by Member States under the Water Framework Directive, particularly for transboundary river basin districts. Click on  more info  to see time series in WEI+ including level of sectorial pressures over freshwater resource    Rivers and groundwater aquifers supply more than 80% of the total water used in Europe annually. Around 17 river basin districts, mainly in Spain, Malta, Cyprus, Greece, Portugal Poland and the United Kingdom experienced water stressed conditions during the summer months in 2014. This was due to relatively low net precipitation with large variations within and between years combined with their inability to draw on more distant water sources, as well as intense tourism activities. In addition, near-shore freshwater aquifers are threatened by seawater intrusion. The situation is worse in summer, when average precipitation is very low and water demand for agriculture and tourism is high. This makes water resource management, particularly on the Mediterranean islands, challenging.   Summer is the period when most water stress occurs. This is due to a combination of factors. Water availability decreases because of hotter and drier conditions, while water abstraction doubles during the summer compared with winter, because people and sectors, such as agriculture and industry, require more freshwater, e.g. for cooling and irrigation. During winter only around 7% of the total area of Europe experiences water stress conditions, whereas this rate reaches 11% in summer. The highest WEI+ for the 2014 summer period was estimated for Spanish and Portuguese islands, Malta, Cyprus (81 %), the Jarft river basin in Poland (67 %) followed by the Segura river basin in Spain (62%).   Across Europe, water abstraction from surface water resources accounts for 58% of total water use, with the remaining 42% coming from ground water. The WEI+ is driven by two important factors: (1) climate, which controls water availability and seasonality in water supply, and (2) water demand, which is largely driven by the population density and related economic activities. Thus, a strong relationship exists between this indicator and water use by economic sectors.   In general, a decrease in water abstraction in Europe has been observed for some economic sectors since the 1990s (Figure 2). In the EU-27 (plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland), the industrial sector has improved its water efficiency, leading to a significant decrease (28%) in water abstraction over this period. Agriculture has achieved a 7% decrease in water abstraction, yet remains the sector with the highest water demand. Water abstraction for electricity has decreased by 11% since the 1990s, indicating a more or less constant trend since 2000. Little improvement has been achieved in water abstraction for public water supply, where there has been only a 3% decrease since the 1990s.      Figure 2. Development of water abstraction across Europe by sector since the 1990s        The long-term vision of the 7th EAP is of an innovative economy in which natural resources are managed sustainably. This includes water resources. However, in the coming years, the consequences of various drivers and pressures including climate change, increasing population and continued urbanisation of floodplain areas will increase the likelihood of flooding, droughts and water scarcity in some regions of Europe. There are many indications that water bodies already under stress are highly susceptible to climate change impacts, and that climate change may hinder attempts to restore some water bodies to good status.   While, efficiency gains in industrial and agricultural water use, as well as in public networks, have been achieved and are likely to continue to improve in the period to 2020, hotspots for water stress conditions are likely to remain. If the area under water stress is to be reduced, additional improvements to water efficiency in all sectors will be needed, but particularly the largest consuming sectors, agriculture and the public water supply. However, water efficiency improvements alone are unlikely to be sufficient to offset all the additional impacts of climate change on water scarcity in the future. It is therefore likely that water stress will continue to increase beyond 2020.   About the indicator   This indicator, commonly known as the WEI+, aims to illustrate water use. It shows the percentage used of the total renewable freshwater resources available. A WEI+ above 20% implies that a water resource is under stress, and more than 40% indicates severe stress and clearly unsustainable use of the resource (Raskin et al., 1997).   WEI+ data are available at fine spatial (e.g. sub-basin or river basin) and temporal (monthly or seasonal) scales to better capture local and seasonal variation in the pressure on renewable freshwater resources. The indicator focuses on water quantity. For some aspects of freshwater quality, see the Surface waters briefing ( AIRS_PO1.9, 2016 ). 1    Data on water use have also been derived from various sources such as WISE 3, EPRT-R, UWWTPs, Eurostat water data which have been integrated in the EEA water accounts production database. The methodology and latest assessment has a special focus on water use by economic sectors (see EEA, 2016).,<div class='pageBreak'></div> <table class='plain' style='width: 555px;'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p><b>EU indicator past trend</b></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p><b><span>Selected objective to be met by 2020</span></b></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Use of freshwater resources</p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p align='center'><span style='text-align: left; '> <img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /> </span></p> </td> <td width='177'> <p align='center'><span>Water abstraction should stay below 20% of available renewable freshwater resources  Roadmap to a resource efficient Europe<br /></span></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p style='text-align: center; '><em><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/icons/yellow-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/da466c84-2e67-4e97-83a1-3a87190ae755.jpeg' alt='Stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' title='Yellow circle: it is uncertain whether or not the objective will be met by 2020' /></em></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p><span>While efficiency gains have been achieved, </span><span>hotspots for water stress conditions are likely to remain given continued pressures such as climate change, increasing population and rapid urbanisation</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><span class='discreet'><span class='discreet'>For further information on the scoreboard methodology please see Box I.1 in the <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/environmental-indicator-report-2016-2014' class='internal-link' target='_self'>EEA Environmental indicator report 2016</a></span></span></p> <h2><span>Setting the Scene</span></h2> <p>The 7th EAP aims to ensure that, by 2020, water stress (stress on available water resources) is prevented or significantly reduced in the European Union (EU, 2013).

A WEI+ above 20% implies that a water resource is under stress, and more than 40% indicates severe stress and clearly unsustainable use of the resource (Raskin et al., 1997).</p> <p>WEI+ data are available at fine spatial (e.g. sub-basin or river basin) and temporal (monthly or seasonal) scales to better capture local and seasonal variation in the pressure on renewable freshwater resources. The indicator focuses on water quantity. For some aspects of freshwater quality, see the Surface waters briefing (<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/natural-capital/trends-in-the-ecological-status' class='internal-link' target='_self'>AIRS_PO1.9, 2016</a>).<sup>1</sup></p> <p>Data on water use have also been derived from various sources such as WISE 3, EPRT-R, UWWTPs, Eurostat water data which have been integrated in the EEA water accounts production database. The methodology and latest assessment has a special focus on water use by economic sectors (see EEA, 2016).</p>","Freshwater use",,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) aims to ensure that, by 2020, water stress (lack of water) is prevented or significantly reduced in the EU. Water is an essential component for preserving biodiversity and maintaining other freshwater ecosystem services such as public water supply. Freshwater also serves as a vital input to economic activities across Europe, including agriculture, tourism and industrial activities.</p> <p>While freshwater is relatively abundant in Europe, water availability and socio-economic activity are unevenly distributed, leading to major differences in water stress levels across the continent. With the exception of some northern and sparsely populated areas that possess abundant freshwater resources, water stress occurs in many areas of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of the Atlantic region, because they are confronted with a difficult combination of both a severe lack of freshwater and a high demand for it.</p> <p>In general, a decrease in water abstraction in Europe has been observed for some economic sectors since the 1990s, mainly due to efficiency gains in industry and agriculture. On the other hand, little improvement has been achieved in water abstraction for public water supply. Between 2002 and 2012, water abstraction from freshwater resources has decreased by around 7 % in Europe. However, there are differences in trends observed across Europe, with water abstraction decreasing in eastern and western Europe and a slight increase in southern Europe.</p> <p>While efficiency gains in industrial and agricultural water use, as well as in public networks, have been achieved and are likely to continue to improve in the period to 2020, hotspots for water stress conditions are likely to remain, given continued pressures such as climate change, increasing population and rapid urbanisation. However, because other drivers and pressures influencing both water demand and freshwater availability (e.g. consequences of climate change, increasing population and rapid urbanisation) are expected to intensify, it remains uncertain whether or not water stress can be prevented or significantly reduced. It is therefore important that water abstraction respects available renewable resource limits in order to prevent or significantly reduce water stress.</p>","2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","2017-02-27T12:23:50Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Austria,Cyprus,Czech Republic,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Lithuania,Belgium,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",,"published","Water","http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/freshwater-use","Briefing (all)","2003,2014,2015,2004,2005,2016,2017,2006,2007,2018,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2000,2011,2012,2001,2002,2013","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

Agricultural land and, to a lesser extent, forests and other semi-natural and natural areas are lost to the development of buildings and other artificial surfaces. This leads to loss of fertile land and affects biodiversity, as it decreases habitats, the living space of important species, and fragments the landscapes that support and connect them. Land occupied by man-made surfaces and dense infrastructure is also a significant source of water, soil and air pollution. The sealing of land by these surfaces can also negatively impact the water balance and increase the frequency and intensity of flooding.Land take is also a matter of land use efficiency and an aspect of a wider land degradation issue, addressed by the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, particularly goal 15.3 on land.   P olicy targets an  d progress    There is no specific objective in the environmental acquis that matches the 7th EAP objective of sustainable land management, and promotion of no net land take by 2050. However, the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (EC, 2011) states that if we are to reach the state of no net land take by 2050, following a linear path, we would need to reduce land take to an average of 800km 2 per year (for the EU) in the period 20002020. This average figure is used in this briefing as the benchmark to assess progress. In the 20002012 period, for the EU the estimated average annual land take was 888km 2  (EEA, 2016), which is considerably above the level required to achieve the long-term objective of no net land take. However, estimated average annual land take has decreased from 930km 2  per year in the 20002006 period to 845km 2  per year in the subsequent 20062012 period (EEA, 2016).   Based on the average for the EU-28, 52% of all areas that changed to artificial surfaces were arable land or permanent crops in 2006 (47% for the EEA-33) (Figure 1). Pastures and mixed farmland were, on average, the category of land that was the next most taken, representing 26% of the total (27% for the EEA-33), while forests and transitional woodland shrub made up 14% (16% for the EEA-33). As these land cover types are substituted to varying degrees by impervious cover, the provision of important services provided by soils, such as storing and filtering water, and the transformation of nutrients and contaminants deteriorates. This specific issue is discussed in more detail in the soil section of the recent SOER 2015 (The European environment State and outlook 2015; EEA, 2015).    Figure 1. Relative contribution of land-cover categories lost to uptake by urban and other artificial land development (2006-2012), EU         From the perspective of the types of development that occur on the land that is taken, at the EU level the largest area, 32%, was taken by construction sites between 2006 and 2012. These sites represent transitional areas that will turn into some form of urban development in the future. The second largest area, 23%, was taken for industrial and commercial sites. Housing, services and recreation made up 20% of the overall increase in urban and other artificial areas. The proportion of newly created mines, quarries and dumpsites was 18% in the EU-28. Although land take for transport infrastructures is underestimated in the Corine Land Cover dataset, it still covered 7% of the area taken. A similar pattern emerges when looking at all 33 EEA member countries (EEA, 2016).   Land use in Europe is shaped by the links between economic activity, increased mobility and growth in transport infrastructure and a number of other drivers, such as the increasing demand for living space per person. Regional urbanisation rates vary substantially, with coastal and mountainous regions among the most affected because of the increasing demand for artificial surfaces related to transport, recreation and leisure in these areas (see Figure 2).        Figure 2. Spatial development of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries              Data source: EEA,  Spatial development of landtake     As the proportion of land used for production (agriculture, forestry, etc.) in Europe is one of the highest in the world, conflicting land use demands require decisions that involve difficult trade-offs. The decisions on trade-offs between land uses are effectively implemented through spatial planning and land management practice in the individual countries. Although the subsidiarity principle assigns land and urban planning responsibilities to national and regional government, most European policies have a direct or indirect effect on land planning and urban development. Where properly implemented, the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA; EC, 2001) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA; EC, 2014) Directives can improve the consideration of environmental aspects in spatial planning.   The average annual land take between 2000 and 2012 lay above the trajectory required to achieve the long-term goal of no net land take. However, annual land take declined between the 20002006 and 20062012 observation periods. If the amount of land taken reduces significantly during the next observation period, Europe could reach the required trajectory. However, it is uncertain whether a further reduction will take place and at what rate, particularly given the recent period of economic recovery following the economic downturn. The outlook to 2020 therefore remains uncertain.     One way to reduce the rate of land take in future is through the redevelopment of brownfield land. Brownfield sites are derelict and underused or even abandoned former industrial or commercial sites, which may have real or perceived contamination problems (EC, 2012). These sites are mainly found in urban areas of industrialised regions. Redevelopment of brownfield sites gives many environmental advantages: relieving pressure on rural areas and greenfield sites, reducing the costs of pollution, allowing more effective use of energy and natural resources and facilitating economic diversification.Another way to reduce the rate of land take in future is by higher density development, i.e. more buildings or a higher population on a given area of land (EEA, forthcoming).      Country level information    Figure 3 shows the mean annual rate of land take in EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-39) between 2006 and 2012. The graph ranks countries on the basis of increases in land take as a percentage of the initial artificial land stock in 2006. Perhaps surprisingly, the countries with the highest percentage of land take include thosethatare already highlyurbanised and therefore had an already high initial percentage of artificial land stock in 2006. Countries that enjoyed strong economic growth between 2006 and 2012 also had high levels of land take, indicating the need for further decoupling.    Figure 3. Mean annual land take per EEA-39 country, 20062012, as a percentage of 2006 artificial land          Outlook beyond 2020    If the urban population of Europecontinuesto grow, the pressure to develop on natural and semi-natural land will continue.If the objective of no net land take by 2050 is to be met, new developments in future should increasingly have to either take place on brownfield land or fill in gaps between existing developments (densification), or land take should haveto be compensated for by reclaiming of artificial land back to arable or semi-natural land cover types. Such developments could be driven by establishing incentives for land recycling, e.g. encouraging developers to use brownfield land or encouraging spatial planning that favours increasing urban density. The extent to which land take can be reduced in the longer term will also be influenced by the ability of the EU and individual Member States to coordinate their spatial planning and environmental protection objectives.   About the indicator   The indicator shows the amount of land that is converted from natural and semi-natural areas, including forested and agricultural areas, to artificial surfaces used for urban and economic purposes. It includes areas sealed by the construction of buildings and infrastructure, as well as surface mining, urban green areas and sport and leisure facilities.   The indicator is based on the interpretation of satellite imagery from 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2012 (the most recent). The main dataset (Corine Land Cover) used by the indicator does not map features with an area less than 25ha (5ha for change) and less than 100m across. This leads to the exclusion of small areas of land and small changes due to man-made features, particularly in the peri-urban countryside, and it also means that most land taken by linear transport infrastructure (e.g. roads and railways) is not captured, as it is too narrow to be picked up. On the other hand, land take areas accounted for contain unsealed surfaces such as suburban gardens and other smaller green plots.,<table class='plain'> <tbody> <tr> <td width='147'> <p><b class='image-inline'>Indicator</b></p> </td> <td colspan='2' width='60'> <p><b>Indicator<br />past trend<br /></b></p> <p></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p><strong>Selected objective to be met by 2020</strong></p> </td> <td width='121'> <p><b>Indicative outlook of the EU meeting the selected objective by 2020</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width='147'> <p>Land take</p> </td> <td width='60'> <p align='center'><strong>EU</strong></p> <p align='center'><img alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></p> <p align='center'></p> </td> <td width='60'> <p align='center'><strong>EEA </strong></p> <p align='center'><strong><img alt='Green triangle: improving trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/green-triangle-improving-trend/@@images/c9a13b4d-d391-4b00-84d6-7013db5c3c53.jpeg' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; ' title='Green triangle: improving trend' /></strong></p> <p align='center'></p> </td> <td width='149'> <p align='center' style='text-align: left; '>Keep the rate of land take below 800 km<sup>2</sup> on average per year from 20002020 in order to keep on track to achieve the aim of no net land take by 2050  Resource Efficiency Roadmap</p> </td> <td width='121'> <p style='text-align: center; '></p> <p style='text-align: center; '><img alt='Stable or unclear trend' class='image-inline' src='../../icons/yellow-stable-or-unclear-trend/@@images/da466c84-2e67-4e97-83a1-3a87190ae755.jpeg' title='Yellow circle: it is uncertain whether or not the objective will be met by 2020' /></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan='5' width='712'> <p>The EU annual average land take from 20002012 was above the 800-km<sup>2</sup> milestone.

"land-recycling-helps-europe  Land recycling helps Europe to maintain its land resource  Land degradation and taking land for urban development threaten critical ecosystem services, including provision of food and water, climate regulation and recreation. A new report, by the European Environment Agency (EEA), shows how land recycling, such as reusing neglected sites and turning roads or parking lots to green spaces or residential areas, can have positive impacts on the environment and support Europe’s transition towards a circular and green economy.   The EEA report  ‘Land recycling in Europe’   presents approaches to measuring the extent and impacts of redevelopment and densification of previously developed land, either with direct economic aim, such as building housing, or with the aim of upgrading its ecological status, such as creating green urban areas or cleaning up soil pollution.   On average, land recycling has increased in Europe but the levels remain low compared to land take, the report shows. Based on Copernicus satellite data, land recycling as a share of total land consumption across EEA member and cooperating countries (EEA-39) has increased from about 2.0-2.2 % in 1990-2000 to about 2.7-2.9 % in 2006-2012. However, the rates vary considerably across countries.   Land is a finite resource with many demands, and land take and soil sealing have long been a cause for environmental concern. From 2006 to 2012, taking land for development in Europe (EEA-39) continued at an average annual rate of 1065 km 2 . However, land in urban areas is sealed and reused in small parcels and often remain undetectable by land take monitoring. Analysis of land recycling and soil sealing needs more detailed data. For example, measured by high resolution imperviousness data, during 2006-2009 soil sealing increased at an average annual rate of 1454 km 2 .   When soil is covered with an impervious surface, such as tarmac, the functioning of the ecosystem is disrupted, impacting nutrient and water cycles as well as the soil’s ability to supply ecosystem services, including everything from provision of food and water to climate regulation and space for recreation.

"assessment-1  Primary energy consumption by fuel    In 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries amounted to 1 507 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe), 1.6 % above the 2020 target. Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries decreased by 12 % due to energy efficiency improvements, the increase of the share of energy from hydro, wind and solar photovoltaics, the economic recession and climate warming. Based on EEA preliminary estimates, in 2015 EU-28 primary energy consumption was 1525 Mtoe. This represents a 1.2 % increase compared with 2014.    Fossil fuels (including non-renewable waste) continued to dominate primary energy consumption in the EU-28, but as a proportion of total primary energy consumption, they fell from 77.8 % in 2005 to 71.6 % in 2014. The proportion of renewable energy sources almost doubled over the same period, from 7.1 % in 2005 to 13.4 % in 2014, increasing at an average annual rate of 5.8 % per year between 2005 and 2014.

Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 countries decreased by 12.0 %, reaching 1 507 Mtoe in 2014. Various factors contributed to this decrease in primary energy consumption, in particular energy efficiency improvements, the increase of the proportion of energy from hydro, wind and solar photovoltaics, the economic recession and changing climate conditions <a href='file:///C:/Users/vedlugaite/Documents/ENER26/Final/ENER26-2015-Submission3.0.docx'>[1]</a>. Under the Energy Efficiency Directive, the EU has set a target of limiting primary energy consumption to no more than 1 483 Mtoe by 2020. In 2014, the EU was below the linear pathway between 2005 levels and the 2020 target. The sum of all 2020 targets for primary energy consumption by the EU-28 (updated target as notified in the NEEAPs 2014 or in a separate notification to the European Commission in 2015; status October 2015) was equal to 1527 Mtoe. This is 44Mtoe (3 %) higher than the EU target for primary energy consumption of 1483Mtoe.</li> <li>Based on preliminary EEA estimates, in 2015, primary energy consumption in the EU-28 was1525 Mtoe, 1.2 % higher than in 2014 but still below the linear pathway towards the 2020 target.</li> <li>The proportion of coal and lignite in EU-28 primary energy consumption has remained relatively stable since 2005, and was 18.5 % in 2005 and 17.7 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of coal in the EU has decreased by 16 % (1.9 % per year). Coal is mostly used for electricity generation and the low coal price compared with gas and the low carbon price in the EU-ETS mean that coal-based electricity production has low marginal costs such that it is still competitive compared with gas-based production for existing installations (see below).</li> <li>The proportion of natural gas in EU-28 primary energy consumption decreased from 25.1 % in 2005 to 21.9 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of gas in the EU decreased by 23 % (2.9 % per year). This is partly the result of the increase in renewable energy. The increase of renewable electricity has had a significant impact on the operations of gas-fired power plants, which ran continuously (base-load) in the past, but which now tend to operate during peak-load only, thereby reducing yearly operation hours. The consumption of natural gas for heating in the residential and service sectors was influenced by weather conditions (relatively warm years) and income levels.</li> <li>The proportion of oil (crude oil and petroleum products) in EU-28 primary energy consumption decreased from 33.8 % in 2005 to 31.1 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of fossil oil in the EU decreased by 19 % (2.3 % per year). Several factors contributed to this decline: the increase in the use of biofuels in the transport sector, high oil prices for some periods within the 2005-2014 observation period, the economic downturn and energy efficiency improvements in cars, partly driven by EU regulations onCO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cars and vans.</li> <li>The proportion of nuclear energy in EU-28 primary energy consumption remained stable at 15 % in 2005 and 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of nuclear energy in the EU decreased by 12 % (1.4 % per year). This is because several old nuclear power plants have been shut down (in Bulgaria in 2002 and 2006, in Lithuania in 2004 and 2009, and in Slovakia in 2006 and 2008), and more recently, eight nuclear power plants were shut down in Germany, in 2011, in reaction to the Fukushima accident in Japan.</li> <li>The proportion of renewable energy in EU-28 primary energy consumption increased from around 7.1 % in 2005 to 13.4 % in 2014. Since 2005, the absolute consumption of renewable energy in the EU increased by 66 % (9.6 % year). This growth was stimulated by national and European policies to promote renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs and premiums, obligations for electricity producers, obligations for renewable energy in transport fuel etc. In recent years, various EU governments have reduced support levels for renewable energy, partly in response to the decreasing costs of renewable energy technologies and higher than expected growth (and thus support costs), but also in response to increasing government budget deficits following the economic recession <a href='file:///C:/Users/vedlugaite/Documents/ENER26/Final/ENER26-2015-Submission3.0.docx'>[2]</a>.</li> <li>Although primary energy consumption in the EU declined after 2005, it increased in non-EU EEA countries, from 109 Mtoe in 2005 to 151 Mtoe in 2014. The main reason for the difference in the trend for these countries is the large increase in primary energy consumption in Turkey (+4.3 % per year) and, to a lesser extent, in Norway (+0.9 % per year). In Turkey, the trend is driven by strong economic and population growth, while in Norway developments may be driven by growth in certain industrial activities such as the chemical industry.</li> <li>In 2014, the contribution of different fuels in primary energy consumption in non-EU EEA countries was quite different to that in the EU-28. In particular, nuclear energy accounts for a significant proportion of the EU-28 energy mix (15.0 %), while it is absent in the non-EU EEA countries considered here. Renewables account for a have a larger proportion of primary energy consumption in the non-EU EEA countries (20.1 %, compared to 13.4 % in the EU-28). In 2014, the proportion of fossil fuels (including non-renewable waste) was 71.6 % for the EU-28 and 80.5 % in the non-EU EEA.</li> <li>Fuel switching has implications on how dependent Europe is on imported fuels (please see ENER036 for a discussion on the EU's dependency on imported fuels).</li> <li>To achieve the EU's 20 % energy efficiency target by 2020, individual EU countries have set their own indicative national energy efficiency targets (Council Directive 2013/12/EU). All EU-28 Member States have set targets for primary energy consumption. In 2014, 25 Member States had managed to reduce or limit their primary energy consumption increase to levels below the linear pathways drawn between their 2005 levels and their 2020 targets.

"assessment-1  Consumption of meat, dairy, fish and seafood   Consumption of meat per person increased by 2 %, milk (excluding butter) by 6 %, and fish and seafood by 13 % between 1995 and 2011. The increase took place before 2008, while the consumption of these food categories has stabilised or slightly decreased since then. This general trend, however, masks a change in the types of meat and fish consumed. Within the meat category, consumption of beef has fallen by 13 %, while consumption of poultry products has increased by 23 %. Within the fish and seafood category, the main change is a growth in the consumption of freshwater fish by 95 % over the same period.

However, the composition of meat consumption has changed, both per capita and in terms of overall quantities. The average citizen in the EU-28 ate 2.3 kg less beef in 2011 than in 1995 (a 13 % decrease), but 4.0 kg more poultry (a 23 % increase) (Figure 1). Pork consumption remained relatively stable.

This is counter-balanced by an increased consumption of cheese and cream<span>(Figure 1)</span>.</p> <p>Different meat and dairy products also lead to significantly different environmental impacts. For example, (intensively farmed) beef leads to seven times the greenhouse gas emissions, a six times greater nature occupancy and a four times higher eutrophication loading than an equal amount of poultry meat. Pork lies somewhere between the two for almost all impact categories (Weidema <em>et al.</em>, 2008). It should also be noted that although poultry generally leads to lower environmental pressures than beef, animal welfare issues related to intensive methods of poultry rearing should also be taken into account, particularly in the light of growing poultry consumption. Secondly, beef from extensive cattle farming can have positive biodiversity effects in upland and nutrient poor areas of Europe.</p> <p>The production of dairy products such as cheese and milk also leads to significant environmental impacts. Cheese production causes impacts at a similar scale to beef per kg consumed.

This gives a rough indication that average protein intake across the whole EU population is much higher than the minimum for a healthy life.

"executive-summary-1  Executive summary  Progress of the European Union and its Member States towards 2020 climate and energy targets.  ghg emissions   The 2016 edition of the European Environment Agency (EEA) Trends and projections in Europe report confirms that the European Union (EU) is well on track to meet its climate and energy targets for 2020. Despite a slight setback in 2015 concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy efficiency, GHG emissions have already decreased below the 20% reduction target; renewable energy use is growing faster than initially planned by Member States in order to achieve the 20% target level; and energy consumption is decreasing at a pace that will be sufficient to reach the 2020 energy efficiency target (see Figure ES.1).   According to preliminary estimates, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions slightly increased in 2015. These increases follow large reductions in 2014, due to an exceptionally warm winter that year that was responsible for particularly low energy demand for heating.   Policies are playing an important role in driving the overall EU trends observed since 2005, in particular through a continued increase in renewable energy use. However, the transport sector in general is a laggard, both in terms of reducing GHG emissions and achieving the 10% sectoral target for renewables by 2020.         Figure 1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets             Note: For renewable energy, the figure represents the trend in the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption since 2005. The 2020 renewable energy target corresponds to a share of 20%.     The 2020 target on energy efficiency was defined as a 20% saving in energy consumption compared to baseline projections. This is equivalent to a 13% reduction of primary energy consumption (or an 8% reduction in final energy consumption) from 2005 levels. The figure represents the relative change in primary energy consumption since 2005.     The 2020 target on greenhouse gas emissions corresponds to a 20% reduction from 1990 levels. The trends and projections represented on the figure correspond to relative changes in emissions compared to 1990 levels. The projections are presented in the with existing measures scenario, which reflects currently adopted policies and measures.

For greenhouse gases, orange means that 2014 emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) were above the 2014 national ESD target. Yellow means that projected ESD emissions in the with existing measures scenario for 2020 are above the 2020 national ESD target.     For renewable energy, orange means that the 2014 share of energy from renewable sources (RES) in gross final energy consumption was below the indicative level from the Renewable Energy Directive. Yellow means that the 2014 RES share was below the indicative level from the national action plan from 2010.     For energy efficiency, orange means that the 2014 consumption in primary energy was above a linear indicative trajectory between the 2005 level and the 2020 national target.     Further methodological details on how progress is measured are provided in Annexes 1, 2 and 3.     Source: National information reported by Member States to the EEA, the European Commission and Eurostat. See Chapters 3, 5 and 7 for further details, as well as Annexes 1, 2 and 3 for information on data and methodology.       The report also uses official data for 2014 to look at the progress of Member States towards their individual objectives for 2020 (see Figure ES.2). Here progress is mixed: while the EU is on track, the situation differs between Member States.     22 Member States are on track to meet their 2020 GHG targets under the Effort Sharing Decision, which cover national emissions from sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). All except Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg project that their GHG emissions will be kept or reduced below their national targets in 2020, with the current set of policies and measures in place. Malta did not reach its 2014 ESD target.   22 Member States are on track to reach their 2020 renewable energy targets: all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal used more renewable energy than the levels indicated in their national action plans for the year 2014. The Netherlands did not reach the minimum level indicated in the Renewable Energy Directive.   25 Member States (all except Estonia, Malta and Sweden) are on track to meet their 2020 energy efficiency targets, on the basis of their consumption of primary energy in 2014. However, some Member States show a lack of ambition with regard to reducing or limiting their energy consumption: the 28 Member States self-defined 2020 targets for primary energy consumption do not amount to a level in line with the reduction target determined at the EU level.     A total of 17 Member States are on track to deliver on their national targets in all three areas. This is an improvement on 2014, when the figure was 13. However, for the first time that this analysis is made, one Member State (Malta) is experiencing difficulties in staying on track in any of the three areas.   EU progress towards 2030 climate and energy targets    Although the EU is expected to achieve its 2020 targets, current efforts need to be stepped up to achieve more ambitious longer term objectives. For example, while projections show further decreases in EU GHG emissions beyond 2020, Member States project that the pace of these reductions will slow down. The reductions currently planned fall short of the 40% reduction target for 2030.   Maintaining the current pace of renewable energy deployment across Europe would enable the EU to achieve the target of sourcing at least 27% of its gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources by 2030. However, this may not happen without additional effort, because regulatory changes affect investors confidence in renewables, and market barriers still prevent new competitors from easily entering the renewable energy sector.   Concerning energy efficiency, continuing the current trends in energy consumption would be sufficient to achieve the 27% target for energy efficiency in 2030. This would only require a somewhat limited change in the EUs energy system. Achieving the 2030 targets nevertheless requires not only the effective implementation of energy efficiency measures, but also a rapid change in consumer behaviour.   Policy proposals are currently under discussion between Member States and at the European Parliament in order to achieve the EUs 2030 objectives under the climate and energy framework and the Energy Union Framework Strategy. These include a revision of the EU ETS, new binding national targets on GHG emissions for the period from 2021 to 2030 under the Effort Sharing Regulation, and the integration of land use and forestry in the policy framework. The Commission is also scheduled to table proposals for revising the Renewable Energy and the Energy Efficiency Directives, as well as rules for the electricity market.   A new governance system is also being developed in order to ensure that these policies and measures adequately support the transition to a low-carbon, competitive EU economy. The proposed new governance includes (1) a structured, political dialogue between the Commission, Member States and other EU institutions; (2) streamlined planning, reporting and monitoring across the energy and climate fields; and (3) stronger regional cooperation.   Outlook for greenhouse gas trends in 2050   The 2016 analysis of progress towards long-term decarbonisation targets in the EU has not changed since the 2015 assessment: although the EU and its Member States are making good progress towards their short-term goals on climate and energy, they will have to intensify their efforts considerably to meet longer-term energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050. The pace of GHG emission reductions after 2020 should actually increase in order to achieve targets, rather than slow down as is currently projected by Member States. Assuming the necessary emission cuts required to achieve the 2030 target actually take place, an even deeper reduction would still need to be achieved between the 2030 target level (40% below 1990 levels) and the EU objective for 2050 (at least 80% below 1990 levels). This reduction will have to be two to three times greater than the decrease from current levels necessary to meet the 2030 target, which is itself greater than that achieved since 1990. In short, ambition levels need to be stepped up.   As underlined in the EEA report,The European environment - state and outlook 2015, achieving the EUs long-term decarbonisation objective can take place only in the context of a major transformation of the EUs socio-technical systems such as the energy, food, mobility and urban systems. As the effects of policies and measures often take time to materialise, action aimed at achieving the long-term targets cannot be delayed. Member States tend to prioritise low-cost mitigation measures, but they should also take into consideration the long-term mitigation potential of other measures, including those that are often postponed because of high current costs or other difficulties related to their implementation. Investments in these measures often make economic sense, even in the short term, as they significantly contribute to the generation of learning effects and thereby foster future cost reductions.   Figure 3 Greenhouse gas emission trends, projections and targets in the EU           Note: The greenhouse gas emission trends, projections and targets include emissions from international aviation, and exclude emissions and removals from the land-use sector. The with existing measures (WEM) scenario reflects existing policies and measures, while the with additional measures (WAM) scenario takes into account the additional effects of planned measures reported by Member States. For the most part, these projections were reported in 2015 and therefore do not reflect the expected effects of recent policy proposals such as the reform of the EU ETS and other measures in non-ETS sectors for the period after 2020.

About this report   The 2016 edition of the annual EEA report,Trends and projections in Europe,provides an updated assessment of the progress of the EU and European countries towards their climate mitigation and energy targets. The report is mainly based on national data on GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy consumption for 2014, preliminary (approximated or proxy) data for 2015 and projections reported by Member States concerning expected trends in GHG emissions until 2035.

Despite a slight setback in 2015 concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy efficiency, GHG emissions have already decreased below the 20% reduction target; renewable energy use is growing faster than initially planned by Member States in order to achieve the 20% target level; and energy consumption is decreasing at a pace that will be sufficient to reach the 2020 energy efficiency target (see Figure ES.1).</p> <p class='BodyText1'>According to preliminary estimates, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions slightly increased in 2015. These increases follow large reductions in 2014, due to an exceptionally warm winter that year that was responsible for particularly low energy demand for heating.</p> <p class='BodyText1'>Policies are playing an important role in driving the overall EU trends observed since 2005, in particular through a continued increase in renewable energy use.

"assessment-1  Efficiency of conventional thermal electricity and heat production   Between 2005 and 2014, the efficiency of public conventional thermal power plants more or less stabilised in the EU-28 at around 48 %. In the non-EU EEA countries, this efficiency dropped to 44 %.   The efficiency of electricity and heat production from autoproducer conventional thermal power plants in the EU and non-EU EEA countries decreased by about 2.5 percentage points, from 59.4% in 2005 to 56.9% in 2014.   electricity heat energy   ENER ENER019 019,<ul> <li>Between 2005 and 2014, the average efficiency of public electricity and heat conventional thermal power plants stabilised at around 48 % (see Figure 1). In 2014, the figure was 47.6 %. In the non-EU EEA countries such as Iceland, Norway and Turkey, the average efficiency of public conventional thermal power plants decreased from 45.9 % in 2005 to 41.8 % in 2014 [1].</li> <li>In the EU-28, the increase in efficiency between 2005 and 2010 is explained by the increased use of natural gas-fired power plants with higher efficiencies and the decreased use of coal, lignite and nuclear fuels (coal, lignite and nuclear power plants have relatively lower efficiencies) (see ENER038). After 2010, the average efficiency of public electricity and heat conventional thermal power plants decreased because of the increased use of coal, lignite and biomass fuels, and the decreased use of natural gas fuels. About half of the decrease in efficiency between 2010 and 2014 can be attributed to the changes in fuel mix (see ENER038).</li> <li>In 2014, the average efficiency for district heating conventional thermal plants in the EU-28 was 82.6 %, the same as in 2005 (See Figure 2). The efficiency of district heating conventional thermal power plants from Iceland decreased from 82.9 % in 2005 to 77.2 % in 2014. </li> <li>The average efficiency of conventional autoproducers thermal power plants in the EU decreased by 3 percentage points between 2005 and 2014, from 60 % in 2005 to 57 % in 2014 (see figure 3). This is largely explained by substantial reductions in efficiency in France, Spain and a number of smaller EU countries in that period. In France, for example, the heat output of autoproducers decreased by 80 % between 2005 and 2014, while electricity output decreased by just 37 %. The total efficiency for autoproducers in France dropped by 20 percentage points, from 63 % to 43 %, over the same period. The situation in France may be attributed to a change in the allocation of energy use for heat production between autoproducers and district heating in France.</li> <li>In 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiencies in electricity and heat production from public conventional thermal power stations were Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania (see Figure 4a). The difference between the countries with the highest and lowest efficiencies was over 40 percentage points. This was mainly caused by differences in the fuel mix used in electricity production (see ENER 038). Between 2005 and 2014, the two countries that registered an efficiency improvement of more than 9 percentage points were Malta and Lithuania (see Figure 4b). The installed capacity was partly decommissioned in both countries; the efficiency improvements came as a result of increased electricity imports. Decreases in efficiency between 2005 and 2014 were seen in 14 EEA countries, with the largest decreases occurring in Norway, Portugal and Spain (between 5 and 10 percentage points).</li> <li>In 2013, 64 % of district heating used in the EU-28 was recycled heat from electricity production, waste-to-energy plants and industrial processes, with the rest being generated directly from fossil fuels and renewables (Euroheat&amp;Power, 2015). Such an increase in the proportion of total heat coming from district heating will have significant environmental benefits. In 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiencies in district heating were Finland, Hungary and the Czech Republic (see Figure 5a). Between 2005 and 2014, the three countries with the greatest efficiency improvements in district heating from conventional thermal power stations seemed to be Belgium, France and Hungary (see Figure 5b). Heat production from district heating more than quadrupled in France in 2012; new and more efficient installations contributed to this increase in efficiency. Decreases in efficiency between 2005 and 2014 were seen in eight EEA countries, with the largest decreases occurring in Romania, the Netherlands and Estonia. In Romania for example, some plants operate at low capacity factors. Because some of the installations are old, the proper redistribution of the thermal agent throughout the network, which should occur when customers disconnect from the network permanently, may not take place. In these cases, the plants operate suboptimally.</li> <li>In 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiencies in autoproducer conventional thermal power stations were Luxembourg, Finland and Latvia, with efficiencies more than twice as high as efficiencies in the United Kingdom. France and Romania also showed low efficiencies (see Figure 6a). Between 2005 and 2014, the three countries with the highest efficiency improvements in autoproducer conventional thermal power stations seemed to have been Bulgaria, Cyprus and Ireland (see Figure 6b). Decreases in efficiency between 2005 and 2014 were seen in 12 EEA countries, with the largest decreases occurring in France, Spain and the Czech Republic.</li> </ul> <p>[1]Efficiencies of public conventional thermal power plants from non-EU EEA countries could on be derived from the energy statistics for Iceland, Norway and Turkey.</p>","Efficiency of conventional thermal electricity and heat production",,"Between 2005 and 2014, the efficiency of public conventional thermal power plants more or less stabilised in the EU-28 at around 48 %.

"assessment-2  Progress on energy efficiency in Europe    Between 1990 and 2014, final energy efficiency increased by 28 % in the EU-28 countries at an annual average rate of 1.4 % per year. This was driven by improvements in the industrial sector (+1.8 % per year) and households (+1.7 % per year). Improvement rates were lower in the service sector (+1 % per year) and the transport sector (+0.9 % per year).

Standards for new buildings have contributed to reducing the average unit consumption of the dwelling stock for the EU as a whole by 0.5 % per year on average between 1990 and 2014, which represents about half of the total savings for household space heating (see Figure 4).</li> <li>At the EU level, the energy consumed by households on air conditioning increased by around 7.6 % per year on average since 1990 and by 2.7 % per year since 2005. More and more dwellings have air conditioning: up from 0.8 % in 1990 to 1.5 % in 2005 and 2.4 % in 2014. Across the EU, the average energy consumed on air conditioning per m<span><sup>2</sup></span> has been increasing by 1.3 % per year on average since 1990 (see Figure 5). Indeed, over the same period, the percentage of dwellings with air conditioning increased in Italy (from 11 % to 37 %), in Spain (from 5 % in 1990 and 15 % in 2000 to 60 % in 2013) and by almost 80 % in Cyprus and Malta. In the Netherlands, Slovenia and Bulgaria, the diffusion of air conditioning is more recent but equally significant, increasing from around 1-2 % in 2000 to 15 %, 21 % and 31 % of dwellings in 2014, respectively. The percentage coverage of the most efficient cooling systems has increased significantly across Europe, where newly sold A++ and A+++ air conditioners increased from 11 % in 2011 to 27 % in 2014<a href='file:///C:/Users/vedlugaite/Downloads/ENER37-2016-Submission3.0.docx#_ftn4' title=''><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>. This increase was driven by the new Energy Label for air conditioning, which has been applied since January 2013<a href='file:///C:/Users/vedlugaite/Downloads/ENER37-2016-Submission3.0.docx#_ftn5' title=''><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a>. As a result of these more efficient air conditioners, at EU level, the specific consumption per m<span><sup>2</sup></span> with air conditioning has decreased since 2002.</li> <li>The energy consumption of electrical appliances increased on average by 0.7 % per year between 1990 and 2014. This electricity consumption is driven by the increasing amount of household equipment (multi-equipment, IT equipment etc.), but is offset by technical progress due to the diffusion of more and more efficient equipment. For large appliances, the improvement in energy efficiency results from technical improvements driven by EU Directives on mandatory labelling for all large appliances and lighting, and on minimum energy standards for cold appliances as well as from voluntary agreements with the European Committee of Domestic Equipment Manufacturers (CECED). As a result, the share of the most efficient appliances (A+, A++ or more recently A+++) has increased significantly: from 9 % in 2005 to 98 % in 2014 for refrigerators (of which 27 % were A++/A+++ in 2014), and from 18 % to 95 % for washing machines (of which 43 % were A+++ in 2014)<a href='file:///C:/Users/vedlugaite/Downloads/ENER37-2016-Submission3.0.docx#_ftn6' title=''><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>. Lighting consumption per dwelling has decreased by 1.2 % per year since 1990, as a result of the deployment of efficient lighting equipment. The number of televisions has almost doubled in the EU over the same period, with around 1.9 televisions per households in 2014. At the same time, the specific consumption of television increased by approximately 0.6 % per year since 1990. Todays high-definition equipment, such as liquid crystal display (LCD) and plasma flat-screen models, consume less energy but are larger. The relationship between screen size and average active mode power consumption of a television is an obvious one: the larger the screen, the greater the power consumption (Figure 6).</li> <li>Figure 7<span> presents the decomposition of energy consumption per dwelling for the EU as a whole, which decreased by 1 % per year between 1990 and 2014. This was the result of two opposing factors. On the one hand, the household energy consumption per dwelling increased by 1.2 % per year between 1990 and 2014 because of a greater number of appliances per dwelling and lager homes. On the other hand, energy savings, mainly resulting from energy efficiency improvements in the various end-uses, contributed to a decrease in household energy consumption of 2.1 % per year over the same period.</span></li> <li>Ambitious requirements for energy performance in buildings have been introduced in EU countries to encourage the renovation of buildings to nearly zero energy building (nZEB) levels. By 2020, all new buildings in the EU should be nZEB according to the EPBD. The required decrease in energy consumption of low energy buildings will range from 30-50 % of what is presently required for new buildings with existing regulations. Figure 8 <span>illustrates the primary energy consumption per m<sup>2</sup> for new nZEB buildings. There is not a single, harmonised definition of nZEB across Europe: different nZEB approaches and criteria are used in EU countries, which doesnt allow a fair comparison across countries.

Together, these four branches represented around 54 % of industrial energy consumption in 2014. Since 1990, they reduced their specific energy consumption (i.e. their energy consumption per unit of physical output) as follows: steel (-3.2 % per year), cement (-1.5 % per year), cement (-1.3 % per year) and paper (-0.9 % per year).</span></li> <li>Energy efficiency in the household sector increased by 33 % between 1990 and 2014, at an average rate of 1.7 % per year.

Since 2005, energy efficiency has improved by 2.5 % year, compared with an improvement rate of 1.2 % per year between 1990 and 2005).

The increasing trend observed in almost all EU countries can be ascribed to the increased use of air conditioning in southern European countries, the use of information and communications technology and other office equipment in general. During recent years (2013-2014), this trend has slowed or reversed in some countries, because of the diffusion of more efficient equipment.

"assessment-7  Real change in transport prices by mode     In comparison to average consumer prices, the cost of purchasing motor cars has decreased significantly since 1996, taking 2015 as the reference point.   In contrast, the cost of passenger services and the operation of personal transport equipment has generally increased.   The vitality of the transport market can be seen in 2009, for example, when overall transport prices fell at a faster rate than average consumer prices, primarily due to a significant drop in the average crude oil price between 2008 and 2009, and subsequent reductions in fuel prices.   Rail transport prices are less closely tied to the costs of fuel as most services operate under public service obligations and an increasing proportion of passenger rail is electric-powered.   Overall transport prices appear to peak in 2012, largely driven by a peak in the price for the operation of personal transport equipment.     transport prices TERM TERM020 020,<p>Passenger transport in Europe is forecast to grow by more than 50 % by 2050 (from a 2013 baseline), and freight transport by 80 % (EC MEMO/13/897). With this significant growth, it is important that prices are monitored to see if users are given appropriate incentives to use more environmentally-friendly modes of transport. Changes in transport prices drive individual and business transport decisions; fair and efficient price signals are required. To encourage this, one of the visions of the 2011 Transport White Paper, which seeks to further promote the attractiveness of certain non-road transport modes, is to confront all modes with their full costs (including the costs of negative externalities).</p> <p><span>The cost of transport reflects changes in areas such as vehicle technology developments and international energy prices, as well as state interventions through regulation, subsidies and taxation (see <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/fuel-prices-and-taxes/ds_resolveuid/IND-114-en' class='external-link' target='_self'>TERM021</a>). Government actions can internalise the environmental externalities of different transport modes through economic incentives. The tax systems of many countries already internalise some external costs either overtly or as an implicit by-product of revenue raising through transport-specific taxes. This can lead to users shifting between modes. The economic incentives for modal shifts can be monitored through the indicator of transport prices by mode indicator.</span></p> <p><span>Prices are relatively easy to measure and compare over time, as long as the product or service in question stays the same. However, there are variations that take place over time that can affect the reliability of the comparison. For example, people tend not to purchase the same cars as ten years ago, and dont use the same package of transport services (price/quality) as previously.</span></p> <p><span>Therefore, only limited conclusions about trends in transport prices can be drawn. Most care should be taken when interpreting the prices of car purchases and air travel. The price and quality characteristics of these products have changed the most during the recent years. For example, in air transport, an increasing share of travelers are choosing low-cost carriers that offer less service for lower prices.</span></p> <p><span>On average, over the last five years, transport price indices for the EU-28 Member States show that real (inflation adjusted) passenger transport prices have increased, apart for purchasing cars and the operation of personal transport equipment.</span></p> <p>Vehicle purchase prices have steadily fallen over time in relation to average consumer prices, making it easier for people to afford a car. Together with a probable rise in incomes, this may have been an important driving force between the increased vehicle ownership in the EU (see <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/size-of-the-vehicle-fleet/ds_resolveuid/IND-141-en' class='external-link' target='_self'>TERM032</a>). Increased vehicle ownership is the primary driver behind increased choice of cars as a transport mode. This often leads to increased transport demand and subsequent environmental pressures as the costs of vehicle use are relatively low and many cost items are fixed (e.g. depreciation, insurance and holders tax). Similar trends are seen in the newer Member States as greater affordability of car purchases is even more pronounced.</p> <p><span>In the past, a rise in air-travel price indices has not been regarded as representative due to the growing market share of low-cost airlines and greater competition. Prices have more clearly decreased for certain origins and destinations, generally those associated with leisure trips and off-peak trips. In contrast, the real cost of rail travel has risen steadily since 2000 and at an ever increasing rate. Since an increasing proportion of passenger rail (especially high-speed) is electric-powered, prices are less closely tied to the price of crude oil.</span></p>,<p>Little information is available regarding freight transport prices. In general, since 1998prices for freight transport on commercial ferries and by road increased slightly. In addition, prices for freight transported by sea, however, are variable, but have, in general, declined. The cost decreases for water transport are largely a result of economies of scale (larger ships, lower average shipping weight and longer distances).</p> <p><span>There is wide variation in the levels of taxation and road-user charges across Member States, creating a distorted road-freight market. Operating costs are significantly lower in some countries than others, which is one of the reasons for the large proportion of sub-contracting; companies will out-source non-profitable jobs to smaller companies, especially in Eastern Europe (EC, 2014a). This level of fragmentation can mean that small operators arent able to fully recover costs such as fuel price increases; often companies struggle to pass on the cost to the consumer, which may be keeping freight prices artificially low. It is estimated that transport has a relatively low share (maximum 10 %) in the price of the final products (Christidis and Brons, 2010). This has an impact on the distance a product travels from where it is grown or produced to where it is consumed. Establishing a fair but competitive market across Europe requires further harmonisation between Member States (EC, 2014b).</span></p>","Real change in transport prices by mode",,"In comparison to average consumer prices, the cost of purchasing motor cars has decreased significantly since 1996, taking 2015 as the reference point.

"assessment-6  Transport fuel prices and taxes      Since 1980, the real price of transport fuel, including taxes,has fluctuated between EUR 0.75 and EUR 1.25 per litre, with an average price of EUR 0.98 per litre.This price covers   all transport fuels and is expressed as the equivalent consumption of unleaded petrol.

Real prices per litre peaked at EUR 1.24 in July 2008, then fell by around a third later that year, largely due to a significant drop in the price of crude oil. Another peak occurred in August 2012 when fuel prices reached EUR 1.25 per litre. Since then fuel prices have fallen to EUR 0.84 per litre in February 2016. The first months of 2016 show an increasing trend. The average real price in June 2016 was EUR 0.98. The price of fuel is an important determinant of the demand for transport and the efficiency with which fuel is used. However, despite rising real fuel prices over the last two decades, transport demand has also increased.</p> <p><span>If taxes are excluded, prices follow a similar trend over the same period. They have fluctuated between EUR 0.18 and 0.65 per litre, with an average price of EUR 0.38. Real prices per litre peaked in June 2008, then fell by around a third later that year, largely due to a significant drop in the price of crude oil. Another peak occurred in September 2012, when fuel prices reached EUR 0.63 per litre. Since then fuel prices have fallen to EUR 0.27 in February 2016, slightly below the average price of EUR 0.38. The first months of 2016 show an increasing trend. The average real price in June 2016 was EUR 0.36 per litre.</span></p> <p>Nominal prices of all transport fuels have, however, risen considerably and the average price is more than two times higher than at the start of the data series in 1980. The real average price of road fuel in the EU (inflation corrected using the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), reference year 2005) has increased less. In real terms, fuel is now approximately 6 % cheaper than in 1980 but 16 % more expensive than in 1990. In recent years fuel prices have also become more volatile.</p> <p>Taxes, as a percentage of fuel prices, have generally declined along with the increase in crude oil prices in recent years. In absolute terms, there was an upward trend in tax revenues per 1 000 litres (i.e. excise duties and VAT) in the 1990s, and jumps in 1991 and 1994 reflect significant German fuel tax increases that were used to fund reunification. Fuel taxes peaked around 2001 and have since shown a fairly constant long-term trend, except in 2009 when they reached a minimum.</p> <p>Apart from the United Kingdom, where the same tax per litre applies for diesel and petrol, all other Member States tax diesel less than petrol.Therefore, in June 2015, despite being more expensive than petrol before tax, diesel was cheaper at the pump than petrol in all EU Member States. This has contributed to a shift from petrol to diesel vehicles in recent decades. This taxation strategy is implemented despite evidence to suggest that the external costs of diesel vehicles are, on average, higher than those of petrol vehicles (see <a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/external-costs-and-charges-per/external-costs-and-charges-per' class='external-link' target='_self'>TERM025</a>). Although they are more fuel efficient, diesels emit higher levels of the air pollutants nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter than petrol vehicles.In 1980, petrol accounted for about two thirds and diesel for one third of fuel sales. More recently, the situation has reversed, with diesel accounting for 75% of fuel consumption by weight since 2013. This trend can be explained both by a growth in road freight transport (relative to transport by passenger car) and a higher proportion of diesel passenger cars in the European fleet.</p> <p>Fuel prices can be used to assess and explain developments in transport demand, as they are closely linked through price elasticities of demand. Changes in the price of fuels can lead to a change in the demand for transport and also have a significant impact in the longer term on the efficiency of vehicles purchased. Despite the fact that real fuel prices have shown a fluctuating but upward trend over the last two decades, this has not been sufficient to deter overall growth in road transport demand. Methods to incorporate price internalisation have not significantly changed, with recent fuel price increases attributed to the rise in the price of base oil. The price per litre of Euro-Super 95 has, for example, decreased by 40 %, excluding taxes, over the past four years (since April 2012, EU weighted average) and decreased by 22 %, including taxes (excise duty and other indirect taxes plus VAT) (DG ENER, 2014). In June 2016, in the EU-15, taxes and duties accounted for a weighted averageof 65 % offuel prices for unleaded petrol, and 60 % for diesel. In the EU-13, the they accounted for 58 % and 55 %, respectively.</p> <p>Road fuel excise duties in the EU-28 are shown in Figure 3 (data from June 2016). Apart from the UK, which applies the same tax per litre for diesel and petrol, all other Member States tax diesel less than petrol. The largest differences are found in Greece (where tax on diesel tax is approximately 50 % less than on petrol) and in the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark and the Slovak Republic (where diesel taxes are more than 30 % lower).</p>","Transport fuel prices and taxes",,"Since 1980, the real price of transport fuel, including taxes,has fluctuated between EUR 0.75 and EUR 1.25 per litre, with an average price of EUR 0.98 per litre.This price covers   all transport fuels and is expressed as the equivalent consumption of unleaded petrol.

"annex-2-progress-towards-renewable  Annex 2 Progress towards renewable energy targets: data and methodology  This annex provides technical details on the data and methods used by the EEA to track current and projected progress towards renewable energy targets in the EU.  emissions trends and projections   1 Reporting requirements related to renewable energy   Under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), Member States need to report on their progress towards the deployment of energy from renewable sources (EU, 2009). Reporting under the RED takes place biennially in a standardised format. Furthermore, under the Energy Statistics Regulation, Member States also report data on their renewable energy deployment to Eurostat.   2 Data sources related to renewable energy deployment   The analysis presented in this report is based on several sources relating to renewable energy use in Europe.   Historic trends for the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption   The assessment of progress towards objectives and targets for the use of energy from renewable sources (RES) is, for the most part, based on information reported by Member States to Eurostat under the Energy Statistics Regulation and the RED, and published by Eurostat via its SHARES tool (Eurostat, 2016).   Share of RES in gross final energy consumption in 2014   The shares of RES in gross final energy consumption in 2014 were estimated by Eurostat, based on national data transmission under Regulation (EC) No 1099/2008 on energy statistics (EU, 2008). In accordance with the accounting rules in the RED, electricity generated by hydro and wind power were normalised to account for annual variations (hydro over 15 years and wind over five years). For details on the normalisation rules, see the SHARES manual provided by Eurostat (Eurostat, 2016). Because of their insular and peripheral geography, Cyprus and Maltas gross inland consumption is disproportionally high for aviation, and they are thus strongly affected by current technological and regulatory constraints. Therefore, they have exemptions with regard to the amounts by which they exceed the EUs average gross final consumption of energy in aviation in 2005 as assessed by Eurostat, i.e. 4.12%.   Approximated shares of renewable energy use in 2015   The approximated shares of renewable energy use in 2015 were estimated by the EEA and will be published in early 2017 (EEA, forthcoming).   The 2020 RES targets and indicative trajectories for the period from 2011 to 2018   The 2020 RES targets for each Member State were taken from Part A of Annex I of the RED, and the indicative trajectories for the 20112018 period were taken from Part B of Annex I of the RED (EU, 2009).   Anticipated national RES trajectories for the period from 2010 to 2020   Anticipated national RES trajectories for the 20102020 period were derived from information submitted by Member States to the European Commission in 2010, in the context of their national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). These trajectories reflect how Member States themselves anticipate their renewable energy deployment to develop up to 2020 (EEA, 2011; EC, 2013).   The shares of energy from renewable sources on a sectoral level   The report also presents data on RES use on a sectoral level (for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport). These data are based on Eurostats SHARES tool (Eurostat, 2016). Approximate 2015 values were estimated by the EEA (EEA, forthcoming).   3 Tracking progress towards renewable energy targets   The progress of Member States towards their targets under the RED is assessed by comparing the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption with two sets of indicative targets for the period until 2020:     indicative targets set under the RED, which are always defined for a period of two years (e.g. for 2013/2014 and 2015/2016);   anticipated renewable energy deployment as reported in NREAPs via the anticipated NREAP trajectories on a yearly basis.     Assessments of progress take place using the following methodology:     A Member State is considered on track (green)if:    its average 2013/2014 share of energy from renewable sources matched or exceeded its indicative 2013/2014 RED target;   its 2014 share of energy from renewable sources reached or exceeded its anticipated NREAP trajectory.       A Member State is considered not on track (yellow) if it did not reach its anticipated NREAP trajectory in 2014.   A Member State is considered not on track (orange) if its average 2013/2014 share of energy from renewable sources was below its 2013/2014 indicative RED target.

Nevertheless, electric vehicles (EVs) continue to  constitute only a very small fraction of new vehicle registrations  .    According to the most recent estimates, the number of alternative fuel passenger cars as a proportion of the total fleet has remained constant around 5 % over the last five years, with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cars making up the largest proportion.

The number of LPG passenger cars almost doubled between 2005 and 2015, reaching 10 million vehicles in 2015. Poland and Italy are the leading countries in the EU-28 with 2.6 million and 2.4 million cars respectively. LPG vehicles account for about 4.3 % of the overall passenger car fleet in the EEA-33. This figure has remained rather constant over the last five years.

After a sharp decrease following theeconomicrecession, registrations of new LPG vehicles have remained broadly constant. By way of contrast, sales of electric and hybridvehicleshave increased rapidly in recent years and together outsold LPG vehicles by more than a third in 2015.</span></p> <p>The number of natural gas (NG) passenger cars almost tripled between 2005 and 2015. However, they still represent just 1.3 % of the total passenger car fleet. The number of NG passenger cars is only significant in Italy and the United Kingdom (about one million), with only small numbers (a few thousand) to be found in other EU Member States. The registration of new NG cars shows an increasing trend over the same period, although as a proportion of total new registrations (0.5 %) their number remains low.</p> <p>The pollutant emissions of properly adjusted LPG and NG vehicles should differ little from petrol vehicles. This is because all three fuels generally contain the same families of chemicals (paraffinic hydrocarbons  petrol also contains aromatics) and because the spark ignition combustion process is similar for both fuels. Only methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions from NG vehicles are substantially higher than petrol, as the fuel as such is 90 % methane, which is relatively difficult to ignite in cold areas within the combustion chamber.</p> <p>LPG has approximately 80 % of the energy content of petrol per litre, while the volumetric energy content of NG ranges from 5 times less than that of petrol for compressed natural gas to 1.8 times less for liquefied natural gas. Despite the energy content disadvantage, both alternative fuels are considered to be promising fuels for the future, mainly because of their widespread availability and alternative energy pathway to oil, as well as the low CO<sub>2</sub> yield per unit of energy delivered.</p> <p>Hybrid vehicles are not always distinguished from conventional petrol and diesel vehicles in official statistics and hence only some estimates of their numbers can be made. While in 2001, only two hybrid vehicle models were available in the EU, and only about 2000 were sold, more than 30 hybrid models are now on sale and around 130 000 were sold in 2015. However, hybrid vehicles make up only 0.9 % of new vehicle sales in the EU.</p> <p>Electric cars are slowly penetrating the EU market. These include battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and electric vehicles with a range extender (REEV). Despite their small numbers (about 268 000) and their small market share (about 0.11 % of the total passenger car fleet), the number of electric car new registrations in the EU has been increasing steadily over the last years. Sales of BEVs increased by 49 % in 2015 compared with 2014, which continues an increasing trend from 2008. France tops the rankings with 17 660 BEVs sold in 2015, followed by Germany with 12 375, a considerable increase compared with 2014 in both countries. Outside the EU, around 22.5 % of all new cars sold in Norway during 2015 were electric (including PHEVs and BEVs). Among EEA member countries, this makes Norway a leading market for electric vehicles in terms of market share. In addition to BEVs an increasing number of PHEV and REEV vehicles (112 365 petrol and 14 580 diesel) are registered in the EU-28. However, collectively, electric vehicles account for just 0.4 % of total new registrations in the EU-28. Most countries in Europe offer financial incentives such as tax reductions and exemptions for electrically chargeable vehicles. Such incentives can include, for example, exemptions from one-off purchase tax (making the cost comparable with conventional vehicles), VAT exemption, use of bus lanes etc.</p> <p>Compared with passenger cars, the percentage of alternative-fuel light commercial vehicles and buses is low, with numbers around 1.7 % of the total LCV fleet and 2 % of the bus fleet respectively.</p> <p>NG buses show an increasing trend over the years, however they only accounted for about 1 % of the total bus fleet in 2015. The numbers of LPG and electric (mainly trolleys) buses are much lower and have remained rather constant over the last 4-5 years. France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Turkey are the only countries with significant numbers (i.e. above 600) of NG buses.</p> <p>Numbers of LPG light commercial vehicles (LCVs) continue to increase, but they only account for about 1.2 % of the total LCV fleet, whereas the number of NG LCVs is much smaller at about 0.5 %. Poland is the only country with a significant number of LPG LCVs (around 200 000) and Italy has the highest number of NG LCVs (about 99 000). At slightly above 1.4 % over the last three years (20132015), the registration of new alternative-fuel LCVs remains low.</p>","Alternative-fuel vehicles as a proportion of the total fleet",,"Compared with 2014, sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the EU-28 increased by 49 % in 2015, continuing a steep upward trend since 2008.

In the EEA-33, the total length of motorways increased by   77 % between   1990 and 2014. This compared with increases of 16 % for inland waterways  and 19 %  for pipelines. The total length of railways decreased by 9 % over the same time period.     Infrastructure length is only a proxy measure for capacity, but the steady decrease in the length of conventional rail infrastructure between 1990 and today indicates a corresponding reduction in capacity.      The full extent of the increase in road transport capacity on motorways may be understated, as the total length of motorways may have increased even more than shown because additional lanes are not counted (see the Indicator specification). In contrast, the railway figures give total track length, not length by route.     Increasing infrastructure capacity is not always necessary to cope with capacity and congestion problems. Optimisation of the capacity of the existing infrastructure through interconnectivity, interoperability and intermodality still has much potential throughout Europe. In addition, policies to optimise networkusage patterns, such as road pricing, have yet to be fully exploited.

Infrastructure length is only a proxy measure for capacity, but the steady decrease in the length of conventional rail infrastructure between 1990 and today indicates a corresponding reduction in capacity.      The full extent of the increase in road transport capacity on motorways may be understated, as the total length of motorways may have increased even more than shown because additional lanes are not counted (see the Indicator specification). In contrast, the railway figures give total track length, not length by route.     Increasing infrastructure capacity is not always necessary to cope with capacity and congestion problems. Optimisation of the capacity of the existing infrastructure through interconnectivity, interoperability and intermodality still has much potential throughout Europe. In addition, policies to optimise networkusage patterns, such as road pricing, have yet to be fully exploited. The application of these could be environmentally and socially beneficial compared with the construction of new infrastructure.","2016-12-01T10:15:16Z","2017-02-21T10:32:47Z","Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Liechtenstein,Austria,Cyprus,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Czech Republic,Hungary,France,Norway,Netherlands,Germany,Greece,Lithuania,Belgium,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",,"published","Transport","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/capacity-of-infrastructure-networks-1/assessment","Indicator assessment","2003,2015,2005,2017,2007,1991,2009,1994,1984,1992,1982,2010,1998,2000,1988,2012,1996,2002,1986,2014,2004,2016,2006,1990,2018,2008,1983,1995,1981,1993,1987,2011,1999,1985,2001,1997,2013,1989","application/pdf","en","European Environment Agency (EEA)"

"assessment-6  Final energy consumption by mode of transport       The annual energy consumption in transport in the EEA-33 grew by 38 % between 1990 and 2007. However, the economic recession caused a subsequent decline in transport demand leading to an 8 % decrease in the related energy demand between 2007 and 2014. Nevertheless, between 1990 and 2014, there was a 27 % net growth in the energy consumption in transport in the EEA-33.     The shipping sector saw the greatest decline in energy consumption during the economic recession; it dropped by 11 % between 2008 and 2009 alone, with a total decrease of 23 % between 2007 and 2014. Total energy use in road, aviation and rail transport fell by 5 % between 2007 and 2014.     Road transport accounts for the largest share of energy consumption, with 74 % of the total EEA-33 demand in 2014. Despite a decrease in energy consumption since the recession, road transport energy consumption in 2014 was still 25 % higher than in 1990.

In 2014, it was the mode with the second highest energy consumption after road transport. This growth has mostly come from the EU-15, where air transport fuel consumption increased by 71 % over the period. The strongest period of growth for aviation in the EEA-33 was between 1990 and 2007, when it grew by 84 %. However, between 2007 and 2014, energy consumption in aviation in the EEA-33 fell by 4 %. Air transport is predicted to be the mode which sees highest growth, and to become the second most important passenger mode after road transport by 2050, due, for example, to the increasing number of international trips to emerging economies in Asia. Nonetheless, energy consumption is predicted to grow less than aviation activity as more energy efficient aircraft are introduced and the fleet is renewed. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has set ambitious targets for reductions in fuel consumption and emissions by improving fuel efficiency by 1.5 % per year until 2020 and capping aviation emissions from 2020 (EC, 2013).</p> <p><span>Since 1990, decreasing share of road gasoline consumption was exchanged with increased use of road diesel - a share of road gasoline in total transport energy consumption decreased significantly from 43 % to 20 % in 2014, whereas a share of road diesel increased from 31 % to 49 % in EU-28 (see Figure 4).

"renewables-continue-to-grow-in  Renewables continue to grow in the EU, but Member States need to step up ambition on energy savings  The EU Member States have lowered their energy consumption in recent years, despite a slight increase in 2015. At the same time, they use more and more renewable energy. Overall, the 28 Member States are collectively well on their way to meeting their 2020 targets on renewables, energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions. However, continuing current trends will fall short of longer term objectives, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) assessment published today.    The day after the European Commission proposed  a package to boost clean energy , the EEA presented a new assessment ofthe progress made by EU Member States in meeting their existing 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Our report Trends and projections in Europe 2016 shows that the EU's 2020 targets on energy and climate are now well within reach. But certain trends are alarming, in particular for transport. In that sector, renewable energy use remains insufficient and greenhouse gas emissions are rising again, said Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director. The way forward is clear: Member States must step up national ambition and efforts to achieve the 2020 and 2030 EU targets, and to keep the EU on a path to a low-carbon, competitive and circular economy by 2050.   On track for 2020 targets   By 2020, 20% of the EUs gross final energy consumption should come from renewable sources. Preliminary estimates for 2015 show that the share of renewables in the EUs final energy consumption continued to increase, reaching a level of 16.4%. This is up from 16.0% in 2014. Twenty two Member States (all except France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) are on track to achieve or exceed the levels of renewable energy set in their national action plans.   The EUs 2020 target on energy efficiency corresponds to a 13% reduction of primary energy consumption compared with the 2005 level. Preliminary estimates show that the EUs energy consumption in 2015 was 11% below 2005, despite a 1% increase between 2014 and 2015. The EU remains on track to achieve its 2020 energy efficiency target. Except for Estonia, Malta and Sweden, all EU Member States are on course to meet their targets on primary energy consumption. However, Member States show an overall lack of ambition with regard to their 2020 energy efficiency targets.

The EU can achieve its 2030 target on renewables if the current pace across Europe is maintained. However, this will require additional efforts because regulatory changes affect investors confidence in renewables, while market barriers persist.

"annex-3-progress-towards-energy  Annex 3 Progress towards energy efficiency targets: data and methodology  This annex provides technical details on the data and methods used by the EEA to track current and projected progress towards energy efficiency targets in the EU.  emissions trends and projections   1 Reporting requirements for energy efficiency/energy consumption   Under Article 3 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) (EU, 2012), Member States had to set their own indicative national energy efficiency targets. Depending on country preferences, these targets are based on primary or final energy consumption, primary or final energy savings, or energy intensity. Each national target reflects the specific situation of the Member State that adopted it. In some Member States, the targets may still be subject to change in the coming years.   2 Data sources for energy consumption   The analysis presented in this report is based on several sources relating to energy consumption in Europe.   Historic trends of primary and final energy consumption   The assessment of progress towards energy efficiency targets is, for the most part, based on information reported by Member States to Eurostat under the Energy Statistics Regulation, and published by Eurostat via its energy statistics database (Eurostat, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c).   Approximated estimates for primary and final energy consumption in 2015   Early estimates of 2015 primary and final energy consumption were prepared by the European Environment Agency (EEA, 2016a and 2016b).   National targets on primary and final energy consumption   The assessment of progress towards energy efficiency targets is based on the targets set under Article 3 of the EED in 2013, including updates as notified by Member States in their 2014 national energy efficiency action plans (NEEAPs) or in a separate notification to the European Commission in 2015 (EC, 2015). The most recent updates were reported by Denmark and Hungary in 2016 (EC, 2016).   3 Tracking progress towards energy efficiency targets   The analysis of progress made towards achieving energy efficiency targets at national levels involves assessing whether or not the efforts undertaken since 2005 have been sufficient to reduce or limit primary energy consumption at a pace sufficient to meet the 2020 target. This question can be addressed by comparing 2014 (or 2015) levels with a linear trajectory between 2005 and the 2020 national target.   This linear assessment is applied to track energy efficiency progress for the following reasons:     unlike renewable energy sources (RESs) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reliable projections and/or targets for interim years until 2020 on energy consumption are not available at Member State level;   no other indicators/parameters/methodologies with a transparent, well-established and statistically known relationship to primary energy consumption are available.     Therefore, this assessment is based on the comparison between average historic trends and the trends deemed necessary to achieve 2020 targets. To remain consistent with the assessments presented for GHG emissions and RESs, the year 2005 was chosen as a single base year, to allow for the comparable assessment of trends across Member States. This methodology does not take into account the level of ambition of the national target (which varies significantly across the European Union (EU)), nor does it capture the complexity of the national context (economic development, ability to attract financing for energy efficiency projects, etc.). Several Member States defined their 2020 targets in terms of final energy consumption (instead of primary energy consumption): Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. For the purpose of cross-country comparison, the officially reported primary energy consumption target was taken into account in this assessment.   The numeric results of this assessment per Member State are shown in greater detail in Table A3.1 below.

"5-progress-towards-member-states  5. Progress towards Member States' renewable energy targets  This chapter presents the current progress achieved by EU Member States towards their national targets on renewable energy. These targets, set under the Renewable Energy Directive, concern the use energy from renewable sources as a proportion of the total energy consumption.  emissions trends and projections   5.1 Current progress towards renewable energy source targets   In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources in its gross final energy consumption by 2020, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for each Member State for 2020 (EU, 2009). These targets range from 10% (Malta) to 49% (Sweden). To monitor progress towards these 2020 targets, the RED sets indicative trajectories for the period from 2011 to 2020. These indicative trajectories are expressed as average shares for two-year periods from 2011 to 2018, in addition to the 2020 target.   For the two-year period from 2013 to 2014, all Member States except one (the Netherlands) exceeded their indicative trajectory set in the RED (see Figure 5.1). According to approximated estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the 2015 renewable energy source (RES) targets set in the indicative RED trajectories will not be met by three Member States (France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) for the two-year period from 2015 to 2016 (see Figure 5.2). It is still possible that these countries will stay on course with their indicative RED trajectories by achieving 2016 RES shares that are sufficient to bring the 20152016 averages above the trajectory values.   When considering current RES shares in relation to 2020 targets, in 2014, nine Member States exceeded their national targets for 2020 set under the RED. These countries were Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, Romania and Sweden (see Annex 2). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, in 2015, Denmark also increased its RES share to a level above its 2020 RES target.   Figure 5.1 National shares of energy from renewable sources in relation to indicative RED trajectories       Note: For Croatia, the share of energy from renewable sources changed considerably because of data revisions which took place in 2016. This revealed significantly higher amounts of biomass consumption which drove the proportion of renewable energy use upwards compared with the 2015 report.   Source: EU, 2009; EC, 2013; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.      5.2 Progress towards the objectives of national action plans   Member States also set their own estimated trajectory in national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs), which they reported in 2010. These action plans concern the development of renewable energy at the national level, and include indicative trajectories as well as planned RES shares in the transport (RES-T), heating and cooling (RES-H/C), and electricity (RES-E) sectors.   For most Member States, the anticipated trajectories set out in NREAPs are more ambitious than the indicative trajectories defined in the RED(   [1]   ). For example, the indicative RES target for the 20132014 period set out in the RED for Denmark is 20.9%, while this country planned to achieve a share of 27.3% for energy from renewable sources in 2014 according to its NREAP. By contrast, Greece, Latvia, Romania and the United Kingdom have designed trajectories in their NREAPs which are, for some years, lower than those set out in the RED.   In 2014, 22 Member States reached or exceeded the RES targets outlined in their NREAPs for that year (see Figure 5.2). However, for six Member States (France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal) in 2014, the RES shares were below the anticipated trajectories laid out in their corresponding NREAPs.   Preliminary estimates by the EEA indicate that, in 2015, fewer Member States exceeded their NREAP trajectories than in 2014 (19 compared with 22). In addition to the countries that did not reach their NREAP trajectory in 2014, four Member States (Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland and Spain) failed to stay above their trajectories in 2015.      Figure 5.2 National shares of energy from renewable sources in relation to trajectories from national action plans         Note: The countries are ranked by decreasing 2020 RES target levels. For Croatia, data on RES proportions were considerably different from those used in the 2015 assessment. This data revision, which took place in 2016 revealed significantly higher amounts of biomass consumption, which drove the proportion of renewable energy use upwards.   Source: EU, 2009; EC, 2013; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.      5.3 Deployment of renewable energy between 2005 and 2014   The growth in the proportions of RES use in Member States during the 20052014 period is a combined result of the development of renewable energy use (in absolute terms), together with the decline in gross final energy consumption, in 27 Member States (see Figure 5.3). If gross final energy consumption was to increase without further RES deployment, the proportions of RES use would actually decrease.   Figure 5.3 Gross final energy consumption (total and from renewable sources) and shares of energy from renewable sources in Member States, 20052014          Note: In Malta, there was an increase in gross final energy consumption from renewable sources of 4193% between 2005 and 2014. Because of its absolute small size, however, the data may not be fully representative and are thus not represented above. The data on total gross final energy consumption take into account adjustments with regard to the amounts of energy consumed in aviation, as stipulated under the RED.   Source: Calculated from Eurostat, 2016.      5.4 Progress towards renewable energy source targets in the transport sector   The 10% RES-T target at EU level translates into RES-T targets of 10% for all Member States. In 2014, Finland (21.6%) and Sweden (19.2%) were the only two Member States with RES-T shares of more than 10%. In the other Member States, RES-T shares varied from 0.2% to 8.9%.   In Finland, the use of biofuels compliant with sustainability criteria( [2] ) increased significantly in 2014. In Sweden, fuel efficiency and renewable energy use in transport are stimulated through a number of tax incentives. Sweden has a high proportion of flexi-fuel vehicles, and numerous public buses run on ethanol and biogas. Sweden also has a high proportion of renewable electricity consumption in rail transport.   In 2015, the situation remained similar to that in 2014 according to approximated estimates. Apart from in Finland and Sweden, RES-T shares ranged from 0.2% to 8.3% in the other Member States (see Table A2.2 in Annex2).      5.5 Regional cooperation and flexibility mechanisms   According to the latest progress reports on renewable energy submitted by Member States in 2015, 15 Member States (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden) expect to produce more energy from renewable sources than planned, for at least one year, before 2020(   [3]   ). These Member States could, in principle, transfer any excesses to other Member States experiencing deficits. Several Member States have indicated that they would be willing to participate in such transfers.   In 2012, 2013 and 2014, statistical transfers between Norway and Sweden took place (Eurostat, 2016). Norway and Sweden created a joint electricity certificate market in 2012; according to this scheme, an electricity certificate issued in one country can be used to meet the quota obligation in the other country, and vice versa.   Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Portugal have also reported plans of joint projects or have expressed an interest in such projects. Denmark expected to establish a cooperation agreement with Germany in 2016, regarding the mutual opening of tenders for solar cells for plants located in the other country. In Germany, some tenders will be opened up to cross-border participation by foreign plants. In 2016, Latvia was planning to consider quantity and cooperation opportunities for statistical transfers of energy from RES in 2020. Lithuania signed a memorandum of understanding with Luxembourg in 2011 concerning cooperation on energy from renewable sources, including opportunities for statistical transfers and joint projects. Luxembourg reported that no final decision on a statistical transfer or a joint project had yet been taken for the 20132014 period, but has held and intensified target-oriented talks with various countries. Portugal registered an expression of intent to develop a joint project in the area of photovoltaic technology, but no agreement has been made so far between Portugal and other Member States.,<h2>5.1 Current progress towards renewable energy source targets</h2> <p>In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of a 20% share of energy from renewable sources in its gross final energy consumption by 2020, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for each Member State for 2020 (EU, 2009). These targets range from 10% (Malta) to 49% (Sweden). To monitor progress towards these 2020 targets, the RED sets indicative trajectories for the period from 2011 to 2020.

"6-progress-of-the-european  6. Progress of the European Union towards its energy efficiency targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by the European Union in reducing its energy consumption, in view of achieving its 2020 objective on energy efficiency  emissions trends and projections   6.1 Current progress in reducing energy consumption   The European Union (EU) is currently on track to achieve its target of improving energy efficiency by 20% by 2020. In 2014, it had reduced its primary[1]and final[2]energy consumption by 12.0% and 10.9%, respectively, compared with 2005 levels. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the EUs primary energy consumption increased slightly in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014) and final energy consumption increased by 2.5% (EEA, 2016a and 2016b).   The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) defines the EU energy efficiency target for 2020, which can be expressed in terms of either primary energy consumption or final energy consumption (EU, 2012). Meeting the target will require energy savings of 20% from levels projected for 2020 in the Commissions Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008). The present analysis tracks progress towards the 2020 targets by measuring energy consumption against 2005 levels. Using this reference year allows consistency in the assessment towards 2020 climate and energy targets across the whole report, since 2005 is the base year for expressing national greenhouse gas (GHG) targets under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD), as well as national targets under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). The year 2005 is also a relevant starting point for monitoring trends in energy consumption, since, along with 2006, it is one of the two years in which EU energy consumption reached its highest levels ever.   The EUs 2020 target expressed in terms of final energy consumption corresponds to an 8.8% reduction from 2005 levels. In 2014, the EU had reduced its final energy consumption by 10.9% compared with 2005 levels, to levels below the target set for 2020. This corresponds to an annual decrease of 1.2% per year on average (see Figure 6.1).   The decrease in final energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 was influenced by a number of factors, such as structural changes towards less energy-intensive industrial sectors, improvements in end-use efficiency, lower energy consumption in the transport sector, as well as the economic recession (Odyssee-Mure, 2015). Furthermore, final energy consumption decreased by 4.1% in just one year, between 2013 and 2014. The year 2014 was exceptionally warm, which resulted in less demand for heating in Member States than in previous years.   The EUs 2020 target expressed in terms of primary energy consumption is equivalent to a 13.4% reduction from 2005 levels. In 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was 11.8% lower than in 2005. The average annual reduction in the EUs primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 (of 1.3% per year) was more than the average annual reduction required to achieve the 2020 target (of 0.9% per year between 2005 and 2020). In other words, in 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was below an indicative linear trajectory drawn between the actual consumption level in 2005 and the targeted level for 2020. According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, the EUs primary energy consumption slightly increased in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014), although it still remained below the indicative linear trajectory (EEA, 2016b).   The 12% decrease in primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 was largely driven by the reduction in final energy consumption observed during that period. The other factors that contributed to this decrease are related to the production of final energy (e.g. electricity and heat) from primary energy as follows:     The efficiency of the conversion of primary sources (e.g. coal and gas) into final energy has improved.   There have been changes to the fuel mix for the production of electricity and heat:    The proportion of thermal generation (excluding combined heat and power (CHP)) has decreased.   The proportion of nuclear energy has decreased: the conversion efficiency of nuclear technology is considered lower than the average efficiency of thermal generation, so a decrease in the proportion of nuclear energy statistically improves the overall conversion efficiency of the energy system.   There proportion of renewable sources for electricity production (such as hydro, solar photovoltaic, wave and tidal, and wind) has increased: these renewable energy sources are considered to have 100% transformation efficiency, so an increasing proportion statistically improves the overall conversion efficiency of the system. The increase in the consumption of renewables from 2005  and the subsequent substitution of fossil fuels  is estimated to have contributed to a 2.0% reduction in primary energy consumption in 2014 (EEA, 2014).            Figure 6.1 Primary and final energy consumption in the EU, 20052015, 2020 and 2030 targets        Note: The 2020 target represents energy savings of 20% from levels projected for 2020 in the Commissions Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008). The indicative 2030 energy efficiency target represents an improved energy efficiency of at least 27% compared with 2030 projections in the same Energy Baseline Scenario.     Source: EC, 2008; European Council, 2014; EEA, 2016a and 2016b; Eurostat, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c.       6.2Projected progress towards the European Union's 2020 energy efficiency target   No mechanism currently requires Member States to regularly report projections of their energy consumption levels. Assessing the projected progress of Member States  and subsequently of the EU  towards their energy efficiency targets based on Member States information, as is done for GHG emissions, is therefore not possible.   The EU will achieve its 2020 target on energy efficiency if the average annual decreases in primary and final energy consumption observed between 2005 and 2014 are maintained until 2020. This, however, may prove challenging considering the potential effects of an economic recovery and demographic trends on future energy consumption trends.   In its assessment of progress made by Member States towards the national energy efficiency targets for 2020, the European Commission concluded that, despite the achievements of previous years, additional efforts are needed, particularly in the building, transport and generation sectors. To close the remaining gap between current levels and the 2020 primary energy consumption target, Member States should accelerate their efforts in order to achieve their national energy efficiency targets for 2020, or go beyond them.   6.3 The 2030 targets on energy efficiency in the context of Energy Union   In October 2014, the European Council endorsed an indicative energy efficiency target of at least 27% for 2030, in comparison with the 2020 Energy Baseline Scenario target of the European Commission (European Council, 2014). This Energy Baseline Scenario, based on the Price-driven and Agent-based Simulation of Markets Energy System Models (PRIMES), was used to set the 20% target for 2020 (EC, 2011).   A 27% improvement of energy efficiency by 2030 corresponds to:     a primary energy consumption of 1369Mtoe in the EU, which is 20% lower than in 2005  this level corresponds to an average annual decrease of 0.8% per year between the 2020 target and 2030 (compared with a 0.9% average annual decrease between the 2005 level and the 2020 target);   a final energy consumption of 1039Mtoe, which is 13% lower than in 2005  this translates to a 0.4% average annual decrease between the 2020 target and 2030 (compared with the 0.6% average annual reduction between 2005 and the 2020 target).     Considering this, actual reduction targets for 2030 are less ambitious than those for 2020 because the average annual reduction rates are lower than those required for the achievement of the 2020 targets. A 27% energy efficiency target could be reached by 2030 by continuing, beyond 2020, the efforts made to reduce the EUs primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2020. Achieving the final energy consumption target in 2030 requires only a 2.2% reduction from 2014 levels.   The target will be reviewed in 2016, following a review of the EED. A 30% improvement of energy efficiency by 2030 would correspond to a 23% decrease in primary energy consumption or to a 16% decrease in final energy consumption, compared with 2005. Individual Member States are also free to set their own higher national targets.,<h2>6.1 Current progress in reducing energy consumption</h2> <p>The European Union (EU) is currently on track to achieve its target of improving energy efficiency by 20% by 2020.

In other words, in 2014, the EUs primary energy consumption was below an indicative linear trajectory drawn between the actual consumption level in 2005 and the targeted level for 2020. According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, the EUs primary energy consumption slightly increased in 2015 (by 1% compared with 2014), although it still remained below the indicative linear trajectory (EEA, 2016b).</p> <p>The 12% decrease in primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014 was largely driven by the reduction in final energy consumption observed during that period. The other factors that contributed to this decrease are related to the production of final energy (e.g. electricity and heat) from primary energy as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The efficiency of the conversion of primary sources (e.g. coal and gas) into final energy has improved.</li> <li>There have been changes to the fuel mix for the production of electricity and heat: <ul> <li>The proportion of thermal generation (excluding combined heat and power (CHP)) has decreased.</li> <li>The proportion of nuclear energy has decreased: the conversion efficiency of nuclear technology is considered lower than the average efficiency of thermal generation, so a decrease in the proportion of nuclear energy statistically improves the overall conversion efficiency of the energy system.</li> <li>There proportion of renewable sources for electricity production (such as hydro, solar photovoltaic, wave and tidal, and wind) has increased: these renewable energy sources are considered to have 100% transformation efficiency, so an increasing proportion statistically improves the overall conversion efficiency of the system. The increase in the consumption of renewables from 2005  and the subsequent substitution of fossil fuels  is estimated to have contributed to a 2.0% reduction in primary energy consumption in 2014 (EEA, 2014).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p></p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 6.1 Primary and final energy consumption in the EU, 20052015, 2020 and 2030 targets</h4> <p><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/trends-and-projections-in-europe/6-progress-of-the-european/NewFigure6.1.png' alt='' class='image-inline' title='' /></p> <p class='Graphicsourcenotes'><span class='discreet'><b>Note:</b> The 2020 target represents energy savings of 20% from levels projected for 2020 in the Commissions Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008).

"7-progress-towards-member-states  7. Progress towards Member States' energy efficiency targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by EU Member States towards their national targets on primary energy consumption. Member States had to set these indicative, non-binding targets on primary or final energy consumption for 2020 under the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED).  emissions trends and projections   7.1 Progress towards national primary energy consumption targets   In order to achieve the European Unions (EUs) objective of reducing its energy consumption by 20% compared with the baseline scenario by 2020, the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) requires Member States to set their own national non-binding targets for either primary or final energy consumption for 2020 (EU, 2012). For primary energy consumption, Member States have set targets that range from a 24% reduction (Malta) to a 22% increase (Croatia) compared with 2005 levels. A total of 21 Member States have targets to decrease primary energy consumption, while the 2020 primary energy consumption targets of seven Member States (Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovenia) are higher than 2005 levels [1]. Member States can also revise their targets upwards or downwards at any point in time.   As neither Member States nor EU legislation set any indicative trajectory to monitor the progress of Member States towards their national 2020 targets, this analysis tracks progress to energy efficiency targets by considering, for each Member State, an indicative linear trajectory between 2005 primary energy consumption levels and 2020 targets, and by comparing historic levels of primary energy consumption with this linear trajectory. A country is considered to be on track towards meeting its 2020 target if its primary energy consumption is below its linear trajectory. Conversely, a country with primary energy consumption levels above its linear trajectory needs to reduce or limit its energy consumption at a faster pace, in order to meet its 2020 objective.   Between 2005 and 2014, primary energy consumption decreased in 25 Member States. It increased in only Estonia, Finland and Poland. In 2014, 25 Member States reduced or limited the increase in their primary energy consumption to levels below their corresponding linear trajectories between 2005 levels and 2020 targets (see Figure 7.1). If maintained until 2020, the pace of reductions (or limited increases) observed since 2005 should allow these countries to meet their 2020 targets. However, in Estonia, Malta and Sweden, primary energy consumption in 2014 was above these countries linear 20052020 trajectories. In Estonia, which adopted a target equivalent to a 21% increase by 2020, primary energy consumption had increased by 23% in 2014 compared with 2005 levels. Based on the European Environment Agency (EEA) energy efficiency index (EEA, forthcoming), these countries could improve their 2020 outlook by paying particular attention to the residential sector (Sweden), and the services and transport sectors (Malta). In Estonia, improvements could be made particularly to the energy transformation and buildings sectors.   In 2015, primary energy consumption increased in 19 Member States according to preliminary estimates from the EEA (EEA, 2016). One reason for these increases is the rebound in energy consumption for heating in 2015, after the exceptionally warm winter of 2014. Although Germanys primary energy consumption decreased slightly, it passed above the linear trajectory for this country. Bulgaria and France also saw their consumption pass above their linear trajectories because their energy consumption increased by 3% and 2%, respectively. The situation seems to have improved for Estonia and Sweden in 2015. With the two largest annual decreases across the EU (11% and 8%, respectively), these two countries are expected to see their primary energy consumption pass below their corresponding linear trajectories in 2015.   In 2014, 13 of the 21 Member States (Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovakia and Spain), which had set reduction targets for 2020 compared with 2005, had already reached a level of primary energy consumption that is below their 2020 targets. According to preliminary estimates, all of these countries, except Austria, Cyprus and Ireland, are thought to have remained in this situation in 2015. Furthermore, four of the seven Member States that had set 2020 targets that are higher than 2005 levels (Croatia, Latvia, Romania and Slovenia) actually reduced their primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2014.   Member States have already put in place a wide range of energy efficiency measures that should go a long way towards meeting the 2020 energy efficiency objective; however, the challenge remains to fully implement and enforce these measures at the national level, particularly in the event of an economic recovery. Furthermore, Member States will need to achieve reductions beyond their targets if the EU is to meet its overall 2020 energy efficiency target related to primary energy (see section 7.2).   In 2015 and 2016, Member States adopted new measures or improved existing ones in order to fully implement the EED. This is a clear signal that the EU framework plays a key role in driving energy efficiency improvements. To overcome common barriers associated with energy efficiency improvements, such as a lack of transparency in the energy market, inadequate pricing of externalities and insufficient financing, Member States should emphasise the multiple benefits of energy efficiency, such as enhancing the sustainability of the energy system, supporting strategic objectives for economic and social development (e.g. job creation), increasing well-being (e.g. health benefits and enhanced well-being resulting from retrofitting buildings) and promoting environmental goals (EEA, 2014).   Figure 7.1 Primary energy consumption and linear trajectory levels, 20142015          Note: The figure compares, for each Member State, primary energy consumption levels for a given year and the level of the indicative linear trajectory between 2005 and the relevant 2020 target on primary energy consumption.     Source: EC, 2015 and 2016; EEA, 2016; Eurostat, 2016b and 2016c.       7.2 Progress towards national final energy consumption targets   National 2020 targets on final energy consumption set by Member States under the EED range from 22% (Slovakia) to +43% (Malta) compared with 2005 levels. As for primary energy consumption, linear trajectories between 2005 levels and 2020 targets can be used to track the progress of Member States towards these targets. Paradoxically, of all Member States Malta has both the most stringent reduction target for primary energy consumption by 2020 (a 24% reduction compared with 2005 levels) and the most lenient target for final energy consumption (a 43% increase) by that same year.   Although the EUs 2020 target on final energy consumption was already reached in 2014, a number of Member States still need to pursue their efforts to further reduce or limit their own consumption. In 2014, 24 Member States stood on or below their target paths. However, Austria, Germany, Lithuania and Slovakia had not sufficiently reduced their final energy consumption to stay below their trajectories. Despite a target of a 43% increase by 2020 compared with 2005, Malta had already let its final energy consumption increase by more than 42% by 2014, far exceeding the linear trajectory from 2005 to the 2020 target.      7.3 Aggregated ambition level of Member States national 2020 targets   Taken together, the sum of all individual 2020 targets from Member States for their primary energy consumption add up to an overall EU level (of 1526Mtoe), which remains 3% higher than the target defined for the EU under the EED (1483Mtoe) [2] (see Figure 7.2). This is a clear sign of the insufficient ambition of some Member States. It is difficult to determine specifically which Member States lack ambition, as national targets are not directly comparable, since they are set based on different baselines and take into account different national circumstances (including early measures), in addition to political ambition.   For final energy consumption, the sum of all 2020 targets from the 28 Member States (1077Mtoe) is 1% lower than the EU target for final energy consumption (1086Mtoe) (see Figure 7.2). Therefore, achieving these national targets would now be sufficient to reach the EU-level target for final energy consumption  this was not the case in the 2015 analysis (EEA, 2015). This is the consequence of the revision, in 2016, of targets by three Member States (Denmark, Hungary and Ireland); in 2015, the sum of Member States targets for final energy consumption was above the EU target.   Figure 7.2 Overall ambition level of national targets for primary and final energy consumption by 2020          Note: The Member States grouped as Other Member States are those that have a 2020 target for primary energy consumption lower than 20Mtoe and a 2020 target for final energy consumption lower than 15Mtoe. In order of decreasing magnitude of 2020 targets, these countries are Denmark, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Ireland, Croatia, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Malta.

"4-progress-of-the-european  4. Progress of the European Union towards its renewable energy targets  This chapter presents the progress achieved by the European Union in developing renewable energy, in view of achieving its 2020 target. It also presents information on the development of renewable energy specifically for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport.   4.1 Current progress on renewable energy   The European Union (EU) is currently on track to meet its target of reaching, by 2020, a 20% share of energy from renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption[1]. In 2014, the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EU, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, continued its steady growth, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption. This is an increase of one percentage point from the previous year. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the share of energy from renewable sources in the EUs gross final consumption of energy continued to increase in 2015, reaching a level of 16.4%.   The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for 2020 for all Member States (EU, 2009). These national targets, ranging from 10% for Malta to 49% for Sweden, reflect differing national circumstances and starting points. To ensure that these 2020 targets are achieved, the RED also sets indicative trajectories for the period between 2011 and 2020. Member States may reach their indicative RED targets domestically (by establishing adequate RES support measures) and through cooperation with other countries (between local, regional and national authorities; planned statistical transfers; or joint projects).   The average RES share of 15.5% achieved in the EU over the two-year period from 2013 to 2014 exceeded the average share from the indicative trajectory for these two consecutive years, as set in the RED (12.1%). It also exceeded the indicative average share of 13.8% set for the 20152016 period. Moreover, the RES share of 16.0% in 2014 was also higher than the level that Member States had planned to achieve by 2014 and 2015 (14.5% and 15.3%, respectively), according to the roadmaps reported in their 2010 national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs).   Between 2005 and 2014, the use of energy from renewable sources, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, increased by, on average, 0.8 percentage point every year. This steady increase reflects a combination of two trends: dynamic developments in the use of renewable energy (in absolute terms), together with a decrease in final energy consumption. While the consumption of renewable energy grew by more than 59% between 2005 and 2014, total final energy consumption decreased by 10% during the same period (see Figure 4.1). Between 2013 and 2014, the consumption of renewable energy increased by 3Mtoe (from 172Mtoe to 175Mtoe), while the consumption of non-renewable sources fell from 973Mtoe to 923Mtoe. The 17% decrease in the gross final energy consumption of non-renewable sources between 2005 and 2014 clearly indicates a progressive substitution of fossil fuels by renewables.   Figure 4.1 Gross final energy consumption from renewable and non-renewable energy sources, 20052015           Note: Eurostat calculates the shares of RES consumption and as part of this process normalises wind power and hydroelectricity generation, which are part of the RES share numerator. However, the total consumption of electricity included in the denominator is not normalised. In the figure above, non-normalised gross final energy consumption is displayed together with shares of RES consumption in which the numerator has been normalised.     The 2015 data are approximated estimates from the EEA.     Source: EU, 2009; Eurostat, 2016; EEA, forthcoming.       4.2 Projected progress in the deployment of renewable energy sources   If the average annual increase in RES share observed between 2005 and 2014 is maintained until 2020, the EU will achieve its 2020 target. This, however, may prove challenging, because of recent changes in national RES supporting policies, and persisting market barriers for new projects. Other complex factors are also at play, with uncertain outcomes. In particular, relatively low-priced RES development options are becoming scarcer as the easiest and least expensive options are gradually being exhausted. At the same time, costs for new RES capacity are being reduced through economies of scale, better knowledge integration and increasing experience.   According to their 2010 action plans and biennial progress reports[2], Member States plan to increase the share of energy from renewable sources at EU level to approximately 21% by 2020. However, not all Member States reported RES projections, or specified the status of the policies and measures (e.g. existing or planned) on which their projections were based. This makes it difficult to use the RES projections to assess progress towards RES targets for all Member States in a consistent manner, as is done for GHG emissions.   Furthermore, NREAPs and current RES projections do not reflect the recently endorsed objective to increase the EU-wide share of RES consumption to a minimum of 27% by 2030. In this respect, current national documents offer limited information regarding the continuation of efforts foreseen by countries after 2020. The European Commission is expected to make a proposal for a revised RED in December 2016.   Beyond 2030, the EU has no quantified target for renewable energy. However, in order to achieve the goal of reducing EU-wide GHG emissions by 8095% below 1990 levels by 2050, the share of RES in the EU will need to increase significantly, to levels of between 55% and 75% of gross final energy consumption by 2050 (see Figure 4.2), in accordance with the decarbonisation scenarios presented in the European Commissions communicationEnergy Roadmap 2050(EC, 2011a and 2011b). Achieving such a high proportion of RES consumption calls for considerably higher efforts post 2030, as the required pace of RES growth would have to be up to three times that achieved between 2005 and 2014. A higher penetration of renewables before 2030 would balance the pace of growth required before 2050, but further policy efforts and investments would be required in the short term.   The transport sector represents one particular challenge. Because of its significant reliance on fossil fuel-based technologies and infrastructures, progress in developing the use of renewable energy and reducing GHG emissions in this sector has been relatively limited in the EU to date (see section 3.4).      Figure 4.2 Share of energy from renewable sources in EUs gross final energy consumption, 20052050           Source: EC, 2011b, 2013a and 2013b; EU, 2009; EEA, 2011 and forthcoming; Eurostat, 2016.       4.3 The development of renewable energy for electricity, heating and cooling, and transport   RESs are used in power generation, the heating and cooling sector, and the transport sector. In addition to the overall 20% target for renewable energy use in all sectors by 2020, a 10% target must also be achieved specifically in the transport sector, by all Member States. However, progress in this sector is much slower than if all sectors are considered together.   Between 2005 and 2014, with regard to electricity consumed in the EU, the RES share grew at an average of 1.4 percentage points per year. In 2014, more than 27% of the electricity consumed in the EU was generated from renewables, with about 41% of that from variable renewable electricity (wind and solar power). For 2015, EEA estimates indicate that more than 28% of total electricity consumed was derived from RESs, with more than 42% of this from wind and solar power (EEA, forthcoming).   In the EU heating and cooling sector, the RES share grew on average by 0.8 percentage points per year between 2005 and 2014. The share of energy from renewable sources used in this sector amounted to 17.7% in 2014, and was estimated to have been 18% in 2015 (EEA, forthcoming). Heating from RESs is increasingly being used as a cost-efficient and secure alternative to fossil fuels (mainly natural gas) in Member States for district heating and at local levels.   In 2014, renewable energy represented only 5.9% of energy consumption in the transport sector (see Figure 4.3). According to preliminary estimates from the EEA, this proportion increased marginally in 2015, up to 6.0%. After rapid growth between 2005 and 2010, the proportion of RES use in transport (RES-T) dropped in 2011 and has been increasing at a slower pace since 2012. This can be explained by a number of factors, including the following:     The legal framework concerning energy from biofuels produced from crops grown on agricultural land primarily for energy purposes remained uncertain until a political agreement was reached in 2012. A cap on the use of these fuels was adopted in 2015: such fuels should account for a maximum of 7% of final energy consumption in transport by 2020 (EU, 2015a and 2015b). In 2017, each Member State will need to set a national target for advanced biofuels (e.g. fuels made from waste or algae).   The use of biofuels to reduce GHG emissions remains a relatively high-cost option. For example, it is estimated (not considering the indirect emissions related to land use change) that the mitigation costs of biodiesel would be in the range of EUR100 to EUR330 per avoided tonne of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ); for bioethanol fuels from sugars and straw, costs would range from EUR100 to EUR200 per tonne of avoided CO 2  (JRC, 2015).

The 2015 data are approximated estimates from the EEA.     Source: EU, 2009; Eurostat, 2016; EEA, forthcoming.,<h2>4.1 Current progress on renewable energy</h2> <p>The European Union (EU) is currently on track to meet its target of reaching, by 2020, a 20% share of energy from renewable energy in its gross final energy consumption[1]. In 2014, the use of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EU, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, continued its steady growth, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption. This is an increase of one percentage point from the previous year. According to preliminary estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the share of energy from renewable sources in the EUs gross final consumption of energy continued to increase in 2015, reaching a level of 16.4%.</p> <p class='BodyText1'>The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sets national targets for 2020 for all Member States (EU, 2009). These national targets, ranging from 10% for Malta to 49% for Sweden, reflect differing national circumstances and starting points. To ensure that these 2020 targets are achieved, the RED also sets indicative trajectories for the period between 2011 and 2020. Member States may reach their indicative RED targets domestically (by establishing adequate RES support measures) and through cooperation with other countries (between local, regional and national authorities; planned statistical transfers; or joint projects).</p> <p class='BodyText1'>The average RES share of 15.5% achieved in the EU over the two-year period from 2013 to 2014 exceeded the average share from the indicative trajectory for these two consecutive years, as set in the RED (12.1%). It also exceeded the indicative average share of 13.8% set for the 20152016 period. Moreover, the RES share of 16.0% in 2014 was also higher than the level that Member States had planned to achieve by 2014 and 2015 (14.5% and 15.3%, respectively), according to the roadmaps reported in their 2010 national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs).</p> <p>Between 2005 and 2014, the use of energy from renewable sources, as a proportion of gross final energy consumption, increased by, on average, 0.8 percentage point every year. This steady increase reflects a combination of two trends: dynamic developments in the use of renewable energy (in absolute terms), together with a decrease in final energy consumption. While the consumption of renewable energy grew by more than 59% between 2005 and 2014, total final energy consumption decreased by 10% during the same period (see Figure 4.1). Between 2013 and 2014, the consumption of renewable energy increased by 3Mtoe (from 172Mtoe to 175Mtoe), while the consumption of non-renewable sources fell from 973Mtoe to 923Mtoe. The 17% decrease in the gross final energy consumption of non-renewable sources between 2005 and 2014 clearly indicates a progressive substitution of fossil fuels by renewables.</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 4.1 Gross final energy consumption from renewable and non-renewable energy sources, 20052015</h4> <p><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/trends-and-projections-in-europe/4-progress-of-the-european/NewFigure4.1.png' alt='' class='image-inline' title='' /></p> <p></p> <p class='Graphicsourcenotes'><span class='discreet'><b>Note:</b> Eurostat calculates the shares of RES consumption and as part of this process normalises wind power and hydroelectricity generation, which are part of the RES share numerator.

This, however, may prove challenging, because of recent changes in national RES supporting policies, and persisting market barriers for new projects. Other complex factors are also at play, with uncertain outcomes.

"1-overall-progress-towards-the  1. Overall progress towards the European Union's '20-20-20' climate and energy targets  This chapter presents a synthetic overview of the progress achieved by the EU and its Member States in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of energy from renewable sources and reducing energy consumption, in view of their 2020 targets.  emissions trends and projections   1.1 Progress of the European Union towards its '20-20-20' climate and energy targets   Based on the analysis of data and information reported by Member States in 2015 and 2016, as well as additional estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Union (EU) is on course to meet each of its 2020 targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. In fact, the GHG target was already surpassed in 2014 and 2015 (see Figure 1.1).   GHG emissions   In 2014, the EU achieved a reduction of GHG emissions to 23% below 1990 levels. This reduction exceeds the 20% reduction target set for 2020. Approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that GHG emissions slightly increased in 2015, but remained well below the 2020 target level, at 22% below 1990 levels. This increase observed in 2015 follows an exceptionally warm year (in 2014) in almost all parts of Europe, which resulted in a markedly low demand for heating energy compared with 2013. As such, the 20142015 trend can be considered a recovery from the exceptional decrease in emissions recorded in 2014. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 2.   Renewable energy   The steady deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EUs energy mix continues. The use of renewable energy continued to increase, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption in 2014 and getting closer to the 20% target for 2020. This 2014 RES percentage is higher than indicative levels set for that year in both the Renewable Energy Directive (RED)[1]and Member States national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). In fact, approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that the use of energy from renewable sources continued to increase, standing at 16.4% of gross final energy consumption. The 2020 target could be attained if Member States sustain the speed at which they have been developing RESs so far. However, as we approach 2020, the trajectories for meeting the national targets are becoming steeper and more costly projects will have to be developed; however, market barriers persist in several Member States. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 4.   Energy efficiency   The EU is reducing its energy consumption. Since 2005, the EUs primary energy consumption has been decreasing at a pace which, if sustained until 2020, would be sufficient for the EU to meet its 20% primary energy target. Final energy consumption in 2014 was already below the target defined for 2020. For this trend to continue at EU level, several Member States must reinforce their implementation of European legislation. EU primary energy consumption decreased in 2014 and was 12% below 2005 levels. However, this decrease can be partly explained by the warmer temperatures in 2014 than in 2013. Based upon approximated estimates for 2015, levels of primary energy consumption slightly increased again relative to the previous year, to a level 11% below 2005. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 6.   Figure 1.1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets       Note: The energy efficiency target for 2020 is defined as an absolute target, set at 20% below the level in primary energy consumption projected for 2020 in the 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario of the European Commission. In this figure, this target is expressed as a relative change compared with 2005 levels of primary energy consumption in the EU, in order to show the required reduction in primary energy consumption over time. The year 2005 was chosen because it is used as a base year for GHG emission (in the EU ETS and under the ESD) and renewable energy targets. It also corresponds to a peak in energy consumption in the EU.

To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this long-term objective, the European Council (i.e. the EU heads of state or government) agreed, in October 2014, on a climate and energy policy framework for the EU, and endorsed new climate and energy targets for 2030 (European Council, 2014). The framework includes:     a binding target of at least a 40% reduction in domestic GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, with individual targets at the Member State level;   a target for RES consumption to be at least 27% of final energy consumption by 2030; this target is binding at EU level, but there are no fixed targets for individual Member States;   an indicative target at EU level of at least a 27% improvement in energy efficiency in 2030 compared with projections of future energy consumption (based on the European Commissions 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008)), which is equivalent to a reduction of primary energy consumption by about 20% compared with 2005 levels. For final energy consumption, the 2030 target would be equivalent to a 12% decrease from 2005 levels. This target will be reviewed in 2016, with an EU level of 30% in mind.     Progress towards these 2030 targets is not as evident as it is for 2020 targets:     According to Member States projections, a reduction of EU GHG emissions of between 26% (on the basis of existing mitigation measures) and 29% (accounting for planned national measures) could be achieved by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. These projected reductions fall short of the 40% target for 2030. In the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing legislation (i.e. not under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)), the projected reductions for 2030, estimated to be between 16% and 19% compared with 2005 levels, would also fall short of the necessary 30% reduction in these sectors.   Maintaining the current pace of RES deployment across Europe would enable the EU to achieve RES consumption above the target of 27% of final energy consumption in 2030. However, this may not happen without additional efforts, because a number of regulatory changes have already affected investors confidence in renewables, and market barriers and fragmentation still represent challenges for new entrants.   From 2020 onwards, the average reductions in both primary and final energy consumption necessary to reach the 2030 targets are slightly lower than those needed between 2005 and 2020 to meet the 2020 energy consumption target. Achieving the 2030 targets nevertheless requires not only the stringent implementation of energy efficiency measures, but also a rapid change in consumer behaviour.     Even if the 2030 EU targets are met, efforts would still need to be further enhanced in view of the EUs energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050. After 2030, GHG emissions would need to decline at a much faster pace than anticipated today in order to reach the 2050 long-term goal, and renewable energy would need to grow even faster before 2050 in order to attain the minimum levels consistent with the EUs long-term decarbonisation objectives.      1.3 Towards more integrated governance of climate and energy policies in the European Union   The EUs 2030 climate and energy policy framework contributes to achieving the objectives of the EUs Energy Union Framework Strategy (EC, 2015b), which was adopted in 2015. The strategy aims to ensure that Europe moves towards an integrated, secure, affordable and climate-compatible energy system, and achieves its climate and energy goals for 2030. It is structured around five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions:     supply security;   internal energy market integration;   energy efficiency;   decarbonisation;   research and innovation.     Progress towards these objectives is monitored annually through the European Commissions State of the Energy Union (EC, 2015a). On 30 November 2016, the European Commission also tables a legislative proposal on a new governance under the Energy Union in order to adapt planning, reporting and monitoring requirements to the new 2030 climate and energy framework (under EU legislation and the Paris Agreement[2]). It will specifically aim to streamline the existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of Member States and to minimise administrative burden. This streamlining effort is expected to ensure the availability of integrated and coherent national data and information on GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. This includes projections, as well as anticipated and realised effects of policies and measures. Such information will, in turn, improve the robustness of the assessment of progress towards the climate and energy targets presented in this report.      1.4 Progress of Member States towards national 2020 climate and energy objectives   Not all Member States are performing well individually with respect to their national targets (see Table 1.1). However, the projected overachievements of the majority of Member States offset the slower progress projected in a few Member States. The Member States progress is summarised below:     In 2014, all of the Member States, with the exception of Malta, met their annual GHG emission targets set under the ESD[3]. Proxy estimates indicate that a similar situation also occurred in 2015. A total of 23 Member States project that they will meet their national GHG targets in 2020 with the current set of policies and measures in place. The other five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) will have to implement additional measures to reach targets domestically or use the flexibility mechanisms provided under the ESD. These mechanisms allow Member States to transfer annual emission allowances over time and between Member States. Further details of this are provided in Chapter 3.   A total of 22 Member States were making good progress towards their national renewable energy targets in 2014, but France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal were behind the trajectories they had set in their national action plans. Furthermore, the Netherlands were also behind their indicative trajectory set in the RED. The situation is expected to have changed in 2015, with only 19 Member States remaining on track, according to proxy estimates by the EEA. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 5.   All but three (Estonia, Malta and Sweden) Member States were making good progress towards indicative national targets on primary energy consumption in 2014. However, as primary consumption increased across Europe in 2015, according to EEA proxy estimates, four countries were expected to fall behind their energy efficiency targets in 2015. Further details are provided in Chapter 7.     In total, 16 Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom) were on track in 2014 to meet all three of their national climate and energy targets for 2020 (see Table 1.1). Ten of these countries need to limit only their GHG emissions or energy consumption, compared with 2005, to achieve their 2020 targets[4]. However, based on approximated estimates, not all of these 16 Member States remained on track in all three domains in 2015.   As opposed to previous years, in which no Member State underperformed in all three domains, Malta was found to be in a difficult situation in 2014, as it failed to keep its GHG emissions below its ESD target and has fallen behind trajectories for achieving its 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy consumption.   Strong links exist between energy efficiency improvements, the deployment of renewable energy and reductions in GHG emissions. However, not all of the GHG emission savings resulting from better energy efficiency and more renewable energy use contribute to Member States progress towards their national targets since these relate to only sectors which are not covered under the EU ETS. For example, most GHG savings resulting from the growth in the use of renewable energy take place in the power sector, which is covered under the EU ETS (EEA, 2016e). The link between the GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency targets is therefore stronger at EU level, for which all emissions are considered in the 20% reduction target, than at Member State level, for which national targets do not cover ETS emissions. Renewable and energy efficiency policies nevertheless contribute to reducing emissions in the sectors covered by the ESD, particularly the transport and building sectors. Energy efficiency improvements and the development of RESs have played roles of varying importance from one Member State to another with regard to making progress towards national ESD targets (EEA, 2015).

See Chapters 3, 5 and 7 for further details, as well as Annexes 1, 2 and 3 for information on data and methodology.,<h2>1.1 Progress of the European Union towards its '20-20-20' climate and energy targets</h2> <p class='BodyText1'>Based on the analysis of data and information reported by Member States in 2015 and 2016, as well as additional estimates from the European Environment Agency (EEA), the European Union (EU) is on course to meet each of its 2020 targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. In fact, the GHG target was already surpassed in 2014 and 2015 (see Figure 1.1).</p> <h3><b>GHG emissions</b></h3> <p class='BodyText1'>In 2014, the EU achieved a reduction of GHG emissions to 23% below 1990 levels. This reduction exceeds the 20% reduction target set for 2020. Approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that GHG emissions slightly increased in 2015, but remained well below the 2020 target level, at 22% below 1990 levels. This increase observed in 2015 follows an exceptionally warm year (in 2014) in almost all parts of Europe, which resulted in a markedly low demand for heating energy compared with 2013. As such, the 20142015 trend can be considered a recovery from the exceptional decrease in emissions recorded in 2014. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 2.</p> <h3><b>Renewable energy</b></h3> <p class='BodyText1'>The steady deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) in the EUs energy mix continues. The use of renewable energy continued to increase, standing at 16.0% of gross final energy consumption in 2014 and getting closer to the 20% target for 2020. This 2014 RES percentage is higher than indicative levels set for that year in both the Renewable Energy Directive (RED)[1]and Member States national renewable energy action plans (NREAPs). In fact, approximated estimates for 2015 indicate that the use of energy from renewable sources continued to increase, standing at 16.4% of gross final energy consumption. The 2020 target could be attained if Member States sustain the speed at which they have been developing RESs so far. However, as we approach 2020, the trajectories for meeting the national targets are becoming steeper and more costly projects will have to be developed; however, market barriers persist in several Member States. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 4.</p> <h3><b>Energy efficiency</b></h3> <p class='BodyText1'>The EU is reducing its energy consumption. Since 2005, the EUs primary energy consumption has been decreasing at a pace which, if sustained until 2020, would be sufficient for the EU to meet its 20% primary energy target. Final energy consumption in 2014 was already below the target defined for 2020. For this trend to continue at EU level, several Member States must reinforce their implementation of European legislation. EU primary energy consumption decreased in 2014 and was 12% below 2005 levels. However, this decrease can be partly explained by the warmer temperatures in 2014 than in 2013. Based upon approximated estimates for 2015, levels of primary energy consumption slightly increased again relative to the previous year, to a level 11% below 2005. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 6.</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'>Figure 1.1 EU progress towards 2020 climate and energy targets</h4> <p class='BodyText1'><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/trends-and-projections-in-europe/1-overall-progress-towards-the/copy_of_NewFigure1.1.png' alt='' class='image-inline' title='' /></p> <p class='Graphicsourcenotes'><b>Note:</b><b> </b>The energy efficiency target for 2020 is defined as an absolute target, set at 20% below the level in primary energy consumption projected for 2020 in the 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario of the European Commission. In this figure, this target is expressed as a relative change compared with 2005 levels of primary energy consumption in the EU, in order to show the required reduction in primary energy consumption over time. The year 2005 was chosen because it is used as a base year for GHG emission (in the EU ETS and under the ESD) and renewable energy targets. It also corresponds to a peak in energy consumption in the EU.</p> <p class='Graphicsourcenotes'><b>Source:</b> EC, 2013; EEA, 2011, 2016a, 2016b, 2016c and 2016d; EU, 2009 and 2012; European Council, 2007; Eurostat, 2016a, 2016b and 2016c.</p> <p class='BodyText1'></p> <h2>1.2 Progress towards the European Union'smid- and long-term climate and energy objectives</h2> <p class='BodyText1'>Although the EU and its Member States are making good progress towards their short-term goals on climate and energy, efforts will need to be considerably increased to meet the EUs long-term goal for 2050 of reducing Europes GHG emissions by 8095%, compared with 1990 levels.</p> <p class='BodyText1'>To ensure that the EU is on a cost-effective track towards meeting this long-term objective, the European Council (i.e. the EU heads of state or government) agreed, in October 2014, on a climate and energy policy framework for the EU, and endorsed new climate and energy targets for 2030 (European Council, 2014). The framework includes:</p> <ul> <li>a binding target of at least a 40% reduction in domestic GHG emissions, compared with 1990 levels, with individual targets at the Member State level;</li> <li>a target for RES consumption to be at least 27% of final energy consumption by 2030; this target is binding at EU level, but there are no fixed targets for individual Member States;</li> <li>an indicative target at EU level of at least a 27% improvement in energy efficiency in 2030 compared with projections of future energy consumption (based on the European Commissions 2007 Energy Baseline Scenario (EC, 2008)), which is equivalent to a reduction of primary energy consumption by about 20% compared with 2005 levels. For final energy consumption, the 2030 target would be equivalent to a 12% decrease from 2005 levels. This target will be reviewed in 2016, with an EU level of 30% in mind.</li> </ul> <p class='BodyText1'>Progress towards these 2030 targets is not as evident as it is for 2020 targets:</p> <ul> <li>According to Member States projections, a reduction of EU GHG emissions of between 26% (on the basis of existing mitigation measures) and 29% (accounting for planned national measures) could be achieved by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. These projected reductions fall short of the 40% target for 2030. In the sectors covered by the Effort Sharing legislation (i.e. not under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)), the projected reductions for 2030, estimated to be between 16% and 19% compared with 2005 levels, would also fall short of the necessary 30% reduction in these sectors.</li> <li>Maintaining the current pace of RES deployment across Europe would enable the EU to achieve RES consumption above the target of 27% of final energy consumption in 2030. However, this may not happen without additional efforts, because a number of regulatory changes have already affected investors confidence in renewables, and market barriers and fragmentation still represent challenges for new entrants.</li> <li>From 2020 onwards, the average reductions in both primary and final energy consumption necessary to reach the 2030 targets are slightly lower than those needed between 2005 and 2020 to meet the 2020 energy consumption target. Achieving the 2030 targets nevertheless requires not only the stringent implementation of energy efficiency measures, but also a rapid change in consumer behaviour.</li> </ul> <p class='BodyText1'>Even if the 2030 EU targets are met, efforts would still need to be further enhanced in view of the EUs energy and decarbonisation objectives for 2050. After 2030, GHG emissions would need to decline at a much faster pace than anticipated today in order to reach the 2050 long-term goal, and renewable energy would need to grow even faster before 2050 in order to attain the minimum levels consistent with the EUs long-term decarbonisation objectives.</p> <p class='BodyText1'></p> <h2>1.3 Towards more integrated governance of climate and energy policies in the European Union</h2> <p class='BodyText1'>The EUs 2030 climate and energy policy framework contributes to achieving the objectives of the EUs Energy Union Framework Strategy (EC, 2015b), which was adopted in 2015. The strategy aims to ensure that Europe moves towards an integrated, secure, affordable and climate-compatible energy system, and achieves its climate and energy goals for 2030. It is structured around five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions:</p> <ul> <li>supply security;</li> <li>internal energy market integration;</li> <li>energy efficiency;</li> <li>decarbonisation;</li> <li>research and innovation.</li> </ul> <p class='BodyText1'>Progress towards these objectives is monitored annually through the European Commissions State of the Energy Union (EC, 2015a). On 30 November 2016, the European Commission also tables a legislative proposal on a new governance under the Energy Union in order to adapt planning, reporting and monitoring requirements to the new 2030 climate and energy framework (under EU legislation and the Paris Agreement[2]). It will specifically aim to streamline the existing planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of Member States and to minimise administrative burden. This streamlining effort is expected to ensure the availability of integrated and coherent national data and information on GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. This includes projections, as well as anticipated and realised effects of policies and measures. Such information will, in turn, improve the robustness of the assessment of progress towards the climate and energy targets presented in this report.</p> <p class='BodyText1'></p> <h2>1.4 Progress of Member States towards national 2020 climate and energy objectives</h2> <p class='BodyText1'>Not all Member States are performing well individually with respect to their national targets (see Table 1.1). However, the projected overachievements of the majority of Member States offset the slower progress projected in a few Member States. The Member States progress is summarised below:</p> <ul> <li>In 2014, all of the Member States, with the exception of Malta, met their annual GHG emission targets set under the ESD[3]. Proxy estimates indicate that a similar situation also occurred in 2015. A total of 23 Member States project that they will meet their national GHG targets in 2020 with the current set of policies and measures in place. The other five Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) will have to implement additional measures to reach targets domestically or use the flexibility mechanisms provided under the ESD. These mechanisms allow Member States to transfer annual emission allowances over time and between Member States. Further details of this are provided in Chapter 3.</li> <li>A total of 22 Member States were making good progress towards their national renewable energy targets in 2014, but France, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland and Portugal were behind the trajectories they had set in their national action plans. Furthermore, the Netherlands were also behind their indicative trajectory set in the RED. The situation is expected to have changed in 2015, with only 19 Member States remaining on track, according to proxy estimates by the EEA. Further details of this are discussed in Chapter 5.</li> <li>All but three (Estonia, Malta and Sweden) Member States were making good progress towards indicative national targets on primary energy consumption in 2014. However, as primary consumption increased across Europe in 2015, according to EEA proxy estimates, four countries were expected to fall behind their energy efficiency targets in 2015. Further details are provided in Chapter 7.</li> </ul> <p class='BodyText1'>In total, 16 Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom) were on track in 2014 to meet all three of their national climate and energy targets for 2020 (see Table 1.1). Ten of these countries need to limit only their GHG emissions or energy consumption, compared with 2005, to achieve their 2020 targets[4]. However, based on approximated estimates, not all of these 16 Member States remained on track in all three domains in 2015.</p> <p class='BodyText1'>As opposed to previous years, in which no Member State underperformed in all three domains, Malta was found to be in a difficult situation in 2014, as it failed to keep its GHG emissions below its ESD target and has fallen behind trajectories for achieving its 2020 targets on renewable energy and energy consumption.</p> <p class='BodyText1'>Strong links exist between energy efficiency improvements, the deployment of renewable energy and reductions in GHG emissions. However, not all of the GHG emission savings resulting from better energy efficiency and more renewable energy use contribute to Member States progress towards their national targets since these relate to only sectors which are not covered under the EU ETS. For example, most GHG savings resulting from the growth in the use of renewable energy take place in the power sector, which is covered under the EU ETS (EEA, 2016e). The link between the GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency targets is therefore stronger at EU level, for which all emissions are considered in the 20% reduction target, than at Member State level, for which national targets do not cover ETS emissions. Renewable and energy efficiency policies nevertheless contribute to reducing emissions in the sectors covered by the ESD, particularly the transport and building sectors. Energy efficiency improvements and the development of RESs have played roles of varying importance from one Member State to another with regard to making progress towards national ESD targets (EEA, 2015).</p> <h4 class='figureHeading'><span>Table 11 Progress of Member States towards 2020 climate and energy targets</span></h4> <p><span><img src='http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/trends-and-projections-in-europe/1-overall-progress-towards-the/copy_of_NewTable1.1.png' alt='' class='image-inline' title='' /></span></p> <div> <p class='Graphicsourcenotes'><b>Note:</b> The percentage values in this table represent the difference between the parameter considered and the relevant target or indicative target.

"quality-of-europes-water-for  Quality of Europe’s water for people’s use has improved, but challenges remain to keep it clean and healthy  The quality of drinking water and bathing water, and the effectiveness of waste water treatment across the European Union continues to improve, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) report published today. However, pollution from sources like waste water treatment plants, agricultural runoff and storm water overflows, and emerging risks like micro pollutants from personal care products pose challenges to maintaining clean and healthy water for people’s use.   The EEA report ‘ European water policies and human health ,’ provides a combined review of three key legislative acts that underpin water management in the EU — the Bathing Water Directive, the Drinking Water Directive and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, which contribute to achieving the over-arching objectives set by the Water Framework Directive. EU water legislation makes a significant contribution towards ensuring public health and environmental protection across Europe.   The EU legislation sets binding standards for Member States to ensure high water quality for drinking and for recreational purposes, and to limit pollution caused by waste water discharged to the environment. Member States must report key parameters of water quality and management measures under these rules. These include ensuring that all significant discharges of sewage from homes and industry undergo collection and treatment, defining water quality suitable for bathing waters and setting requirements for the quality of drinking water to protect human health.   Better water management showing positive results   The EU’s water policies on bathing water, drinking water and urban waste water have been effectively applied across the 15 older EU Member States while Member States that joined after 2004 are making steady progress on reaching the objectives.       Bathing water quality across the EU   continues to be high. The percentage of bathing water sites meeting the minimum water quality standards (of at least sufficient quality) increased to 96.1 % in 2015.    Testing and analyses between 2011-2013 show achievement rates of over 98.5% in meeting EU standards on clean drinking water.   Wastewater treatment in all parts of Europe has improved during the last 15-20 years, with a growing proportion of the population connected to waste water treatment facilities and with the waste water being treated to more demanding standards. Achievement rates in the EU-15 are in general very high, while, though improving, in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the proportion of population connected to wastewater treatment is still relatively low compared to Central and Northern Europe.

Similarly, there has been little progress towards the target for bird populations under the Birds Directive. This indicates that significant conservation efforts need to be implemented to revert current trends.    At the EU level, 23 % of the assessments of species protected under the Habitats Directive indicate a favourable conservation status. At the same time, 60 % of species assessments are unfavourable. There are still significant gaps in knowledge, especially for marine species.   Fish, molluscs and amphibians have a particularly high proportion of species that exhibit a deteriorating trend.   The conservation status of species varies considerably from one biogeographic region to another. At Member State level, more unfavourable assessments are showing a decline than those that are improving.    In the EU, over half of the bird species listed in the Birds Directive are considered to be secure, i.e. they show no foreseeable risk of extinction, decline or depletion.

"stronger-measures-needed  Stronger measures needed to tackle harm from air pollution  Air pollution has significant impacts on the health of Europeans, particularly in urban areas, according to a new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA). While air quality is slowly improving, air pollution remains the single largest environmental health hazard in Europe, resulting in a lower quality of life due to illnesses and an estimated 467 000 premature deaths per year.     The EEA report ‘    Air quality in Europe — 2016 report    ’     presents an updated overview and analysis of air quality in Europe from 2000 to 2014 based on  data from official monitoring stations across Europe , and including more than 400 cities. It shows that in 2014 around 85 % of the urban population in the EU were exposed to fine particulate matter (  PM   2.5   ) at levels deemed harmful to health by the World Health Organization (WHO). Particulate matter can cause or aggravate cardiovascular diseases, asthma and lung cancer.         The report also provides new estimates  (1)   of the health impacts of the most harmful air pollutants based on 2013 data. Exposure to PM   2.5    was responsible for about 467 000      premature deaths       in     41 European countries  in 2013  . Within the European Union, premature deaths exceeded 430 000. The estimated impacts of nitrogen dioxide (NO   2   ) and ground-level ozone (O   3   ) exposure were around 71 000 and 17 000 premature deaths respectively in Europe.       “Emission reductions have led to improvements in air quality in Europe, but not enough to avoid unacceptable damage to human health and the environment,” said EEA Executive Director Hans Bruyninckx. “We need to tackle the root causes of air pollution, which calls for a fundamental and innovative transformation of our mobility, energy and food systems. This process of change requires action from us all, including public authorities, businesses, citizens and research community.”      Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, welcomed the report and added: “     Today's  EEA report on air quality reminds us that we need to keep this subject high on the political agenda. The European Commission is doing so, and is committed to securing improvements in air quality. One way we can do that is to help different levels of government work better together. If a lot of air quality blackspots are in towns and cities then it is clear that local and regional governments play a central role in finding solutions. This week I hope that the European Parliament will vote positively on our reduction commitments in the new National Emission Ceilings Directive. This will provide direction for national and local actors.'         The report highlights that air quality has however improved over the years. The annual average PM   10    has fallen in 75 % of monitored locations during the period 2000–2014. Similarly, PM   2.5    concentrations, on average, have decreased between 2006 and 2014 for all station types (urban, traffic, background sites, etc.). Exposure to PM levels above WHO recommendations have also       decreased     over the years.        Other key findings      In 2014, 16 % of the EU-28 urban population was exposed to PM  10   levels above the EU daily limit value whereas 8 % was exposed to PM  2.5   levels above the EU target value. However, when compared to the stricter WHO Air Quality Guideline values set to protect human health, approximately 50 % and 85 % of city dwellers were exposed to PM  10   and PM  2.5   concentrations exceeding the WHO’s recommendations.   NO  2   affects the respiratory system directly, but also contributes to the formation of PM and O  3  . In 2014, 7 % of the urban population in the EU-28 were exposed to NO  2   concentrations above the identical WHO and EU standards, with 94 % of all exceedances occurring due to traffic.   PM 2.5  emissions from coal and biomass combustion in households and from commercial and institutional buildings have not decreased to any significant degree. To lower emissions from these sectors, it is essential to fully implement measures, such as recent changes to the Eco-design Directive for household stoves, the Medium Combustion Plant Directive, and to provide public guidance on good household burning practices, etc.   Emissions of ammonia (NH 3 ) from agriculture remain high and contribute especially to sustained PM levels and a number of high-PM episodes in Europe.   Air pollution continues to damage vegetation and ecosystems. In this context, the most harmful air pollutants are O 3 , NH 3  and NO x .       Revision of the National Emission Ceilings Directive     Following the political agreement reached with the Council in June of this year, the European Parliament formally votes this week on the revised National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive.     Member States are subsequently also expected to confirm their agreement of the revised directive before the end of 2016. The legislative proposal will establish new national emission reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO   2   , NO   x   , NMVOC, NH   3   , and PM   2.5    which will help Member States in their efforts to improve air quality    .          (1) A number of variables, including population density and exposure, total mortality figures and demographic changes such as ageing are taken into account when calculating these estimates.

"less-household-waste-going-to  Less household waste going to landfill in Europe  European countries are improving their methods to prevent household trash and other municipal waste from ending up in landfill sites. Recycling rates, in particular, have increased considerably across Europe over the past decade, due in part to European environmental policies, according to a new European Environment Agency (EEA) assessment published today.    The EEA briefing, ‘ Municipal waste management across European countries ,’ compiles the latest data available on the EEA’s member countries’ waste management practices (including the 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, with some information on Western Balkan countries).   The rate of municipal waste going to landfills in the 32 EEA member countries fell from 49 % in 2004 to 34 % in 2014. Overall, the rates of landfilling decreased in 27 out of 32 countries. In Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, virtually no municipal waste was sent to landfill sites. Total municipal waste generation in the 32 EEA member countries declined by 3 %  and average generation per person dropped by 7% from 2004-2014. However, the analysis found that there has not been a uniform trend across countries. There has been an increase in municipal waste generation per person in 16 countries and a decrease in 19 others.   Recycling facts   One of the success stories of European environmental policies is the increase in the rate of municipal waste recycling (which covers material recycling, composting and digestion of bio-wastes). EEA countries achieved an average total recycling rate of 33 % in 2014, compared with 23 % in 2004. (For EU Member States: 37 % to 44 % over the same 2004-2014 period). Germany, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden recycled at least half of their municipal waste,  statistics show . Overall, in 15 out of 32 countries, the increase in recycling rates was at least 10 percentage points over the 2004-2014 period. Increased recycling rates and declining rates of landfilling are clearly linked, the analysis says. Usually, landfilling declines much faster than the growth in recycling, as waste management strategies mostly move from landfill towards a combination of recycling and incineration. In some cases these strategies also include pre-treatment such as mechanical-biological treatment, the outputs of which are then recycled, incinerated or landfilled.   Future progress   Despite progress in living up to European legislation on waste management, the outlook for reaching the EU’s 50 % recycling target for municipal waste by 2020 is mixed and many countries will have to step up their efforts, according to the best data available.   It is important to note however, that the data used in this assessment do not necessarily show progress against the target for all countries. Member States can choose between four different  methods  to monitor their progress, and the data uses the same method for all countries. In addition, data on waste and indicators is limited in some cases. Countries have different definitions of what constitutes municipal waste or the make-up of recycled material. For example, some countries include only waste from households, while others include similar wastes from commercial activities and offices. Improvements in waste data and further harmonisation of national reporting methods would help the effectiveness of policy measures.   Municipal waste only accounts for around 10 % of total waste generated in the EU, but it remains a visible problem. Preventing it reduces the associated environmental pressures and recycling would help turn waste turns it into a valuable source of material for the economy. The European Commission last year  proposed new targets  for municipal waste – a target for recycling 65 % of municipal waste by 2030 and a target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10 % of municipal waste by 2030. These proposals are part of the  Commission’s circular economy package  which aim to maintain the value of products, materials and resources in the economy for as long as possible.       waste management household waste recycling rate municipal waste generation waste management targets burning waste,<p>The EEA briefing, ‘<a title='' href='http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/waste/municipal-waste/municipal-waste-management-across-european-countries' class='internal-link' target='_self'>Municipal waste management across European countries</a>,’ compiles the latest data available on the EEA’s member countries’ waste management practices (including the 28 EU Member States, plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, with some information on Western Balkan countries).</p> <p>The rate of municipal waste going to landfills in the 32 EEA member countries fell from 49 % in 2004 to 34 % in 2014.
