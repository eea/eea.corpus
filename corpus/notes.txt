Ideas on what to improve and do next:

1. DONE Add full body of pages / content types in csv file

2. DONE Better tokenizier and pre-processing.

3. DONE strip html code from text with beautifulsoup4

4. DONE Install phrasemachine

#install pip2.7
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python2.7 get-pip.py
pip2 install phrasemachine

#Or better convert to python3
https://github.com/slanglab/phrasemachine/issues/9
2to3 -w example.py

cd /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/phrasemachine
2to3 -w *.py

5. when tokenizing with phrasemachine, do it on one sentence at the time and
not over a large text. Otherwise you get too many phrases and false positives 
made up of words from multiple sentences, somehow phrasemachine expects one
sentence only. OR give up with full text and use only title and description.

6. Stemming?

7. If we take only Title, use only document with Title that has at least 5 terms

8. provide SPACY API see https://github.com/jgontrum/spacy-api-docker

9. FEATURE: Semantic Network Viz: textacy.viz.draw_semantic_network 

see two examples: 
based on POS tokens https://github.com/oroszgy/hungarian-text-mining-workshop/blob/master/1_Intro.ipynb which 
based on pagerank https://github.com/bdewilde/pygotham_2016/blob/master/pygotham_2016.ipynb

10. FEATURE: add t-SNE visualisation. 

e.g. based ona word2vec model of entire corpus 
https://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2017/02/13/using-word2vec-and-tsne/

or just the discovered topics
http://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-mine-newsfeed-data-and-extract-interactive-insights-in-python.html

11. FEATURE: preview top documents when hovering/selecting a node on a visualisation (cluster in ldavis, node in the
networkviz, node in t-SNE etc). 

12. FEATURE: in preparation text, add possibility to extract via NER-algorithm, e.g. one should be able to tokenise only
LOCATIONS and/or PEOPLE and/or ORGANISATIONS etc... and use the standard visualisations provided by eea.corpus
(ldaviz,termite,wordcloud or whatever we add).

13. FEATURE: add visualisation via a map viewer. If user chooses to visualise the corpus on a map than the NER extraction of
LOCATIONS will take place (or existing one reused) and documents will be clustered on a map, a heatmap would be nice.

See a nice notebook example https://anaconda.org/jbednar/nyc_taxi/notebook

14. FEATURE: add extra basic corpus visualisations like histograms and distributions.
  
15. FEATURE: simple corpus document search engine. enter a word or phrase and get most semantically similar sentences from
corpus (based on word2vec/sent2vwc similarity) and its related top documents (where the sentence appears) as results with
active link.

16. FEATURE: after the topic modeling is done. give possibility to name the topics discovered, e.g. giving a short name to a
topic 1 as "Climate change" and topic 2 "Water" and topic 3 "Organisational" etc. The names are saved and used in subsequence
visualisations instead of the topic numbering.

17. FEATURE. Add Wordlcoud for entire corpus on top, below topics wordcloud. Wordcloud should take the terms that are more
specific to the topic (lower lambda).

18. FEATURE: add timeline visualisation. Extract dates information via NER and display documents on a histogram / timeline
visualisation.

19. FEATURE: use textacy DEPECHEMOOD http://textacy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html?highlight=depech#textacy.data.load_depechemood and cluster documents accordingly and / or visualise the stats.

20. FEATURE: add scattertext visualisation https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext to compare one topic versus the other topics OR compare two corpora with eachother.
